These Terms of Use apply to your access to, and use of, all or part of any website, mobile application, online service or other digital asset of Sheetz, Inc. ("Sheetz") (collectively, the "Sites").

The Sites may include interactive areas in which you or other registered users may create, post, send or store messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, video, graphics, applications, tags, code, links or other items or materials on the Sites ("User Content").

You are solely responsible for your use of the Sites and agree to use the interactive areas at your own risk.
Enforcement of these Terms of Use, however, is solely in our discretion and absence of enforcement in some instances does not constitute a waiver of our right to enforce the Terms of Use in other instances.

Although Sheetz has no obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the User Content posted on the Sites, Sheetz reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to remove, screen or edit any User Content on the Sites at any time and for any reason without notice. You are solely responsible for creating backup copies and replacing any User Content you post or store on the Sites at your sole cost and expense.

Sheetz and its users may provide these links as a convenience to you, but the inclusion of any link does not imply affiliation, endorsement or adoption by Sheetz of any site or any information contained therein. When you visit other sites via links or embedded content, you should understand that our terms and policies no longer govern and that the terms and policies of those third party sites would then apply. You should review the applicable terms and policies, including privacy and data gathering practices, of any site to which you navigate from our Sites.

Limitation on Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, SHEETZ AND ITS AFFILIATED COMPANIES AND SUBSIDIARIES, AND ITS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, SHAREHOLDERS, AGENTS AND SUBCONTRACTORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF INCOME, PROFITS, GOODWILL, DATA, CONTRACTS, USE OF MONEY, OR LOSS OR DAMAGE ARISING FROM OR CONNECTED IN ANY WAY TO BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, WHETHER IN TORT (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITES, THE CONTENT OR THE MATERIALS CONTAINED IN OR ACCESSED THROUGH THE SITES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY OR RESULTING FROM RELIANCE BY A USER ON ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM SHEETZ, OR THAT RESULT FROM MISTAKES, OMISSIONS, INTERRUPTIONS, DELETION OF FILES OR EMAIL, ERRORS, DEFECTS, VIRUSES, DELAYS IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION OR ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, WHETHER OR NOT RESULTING FROM A FORCE MAJEURE, ACT OF GOD, COMMUNICATIONS FAILURE, THEFT, DESTRUCTION OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO SHEETZ' RECORDS, PROGRAMS OR SERVICES. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF SHEETZ, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, WHETHER ACTIVE, PASSIVE OR IMPUTED), PRODUCT LIABILITY, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITES EXCEED ANY COMPENSATION YOU PAY, IF ANY, TO SHEETZ FOR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SITES OR $75.00, WHICHEVER IS LESS. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IN CONTRACTS WITH CONSUMERS, SO SOME OR ALL OF THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. USER AGREES THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITES SHALL BE BROUGHT WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE ACT OR OMISSION GIVING RISE TO THE CAUSE OF ACTION. THE INAPPLICABILITY IN A JURISDICTION OF A CLAUSE OR LIMITATION CONTAINED HEREIN WILL NOT AFFECT THE APPLICABILITY OF ANY OTHER REMAINING UNAFFECTED CLAUSES.
Indemnification
You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Sheetz, its affiliated companies and subsidiaries, service providers and consultants, and its or their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, shareholders, and subcontractors, from and against any costs, expenses, liabilities, losses, damages, suits, fines, penalties, claims, judgments, and demands of every kind or nature, including any reasonable attorney's fees, costs, and expenses, arising out of or related to (a) your use of the Sites; (b) any User Content or Ideas you provide; (c) your violation of these Terms of Use; (d) your violation of any rights of another; or (e) your conduct in connection with the Sites. Sheetz shall have control of any litigation or settlement negotiation arising out of Terms of Use or the subject matter thereof.
Modifications to the Sites
Sheetz reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Sites or any features or portions thereof without prior notice. You agree that Sheetz will not be liable for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Sites or any part thereof.
Governing Law
Access to and use of the Sites and these Terms of Use are governed by U.S. federal law and/or the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, without resort to conflict of law provisions.
Claims Resolution
Most customer concerns can be resolved by calling our customer service department at the number listed on our website. In the event that customer service is unable to resolve a complaint to your satisfaction, you and we agree to resolve your complaint through binding arbitration instead of courts of general jurisdiction.
Neither you nor we will have the right to litigate any claim in court or have a jury trial on any claim. Further, you and we will not have the right to participate in a representative capacity or as a member of any class pertaining to any claim.
For this section, you and us includes any corporate parents, subsidiaries, affiliates or related persons or entities. Claim means any current or future claims, dispute or controversy relating to your use of the Sites, these Terms of Use, or any agreement or relationship you have or had with us, except for the validity, enforceability or scope of the Arbitration provision. Claim includes but is not limited to: (1) initial claims, counterclaims, cross-claims, and third-party claims; (2) claims based upon contract, tort, fraud, statute, regulation, common law and equity; (3) claims by or against any third party using or providing any product, service or benefit in connection with the Sites; and (4) claims that arise from or relate to (a) any use of the Sites, including any mobile application; (b) advertisements, promotions or statements related to any accounts, goods or services on or made available through the Sites, including any mobile application; (c) benefits, services, offers or promotions related to the My Sheetz Rewardz Card membership program (including fee-based or free benefit programs, enrollment services and reward programs); (d) any purchases made through one or more of the Sites, including any mobile application; and (e) your application for any account or My Sheetz Rewardz Card membership. You may not sell, assign or transfer a claim.
Either you or we may delay enforcing or not exercise rights under this Arbitration provision, including the right to arbitrate a claim, without waiving the right to exercise or enforce those rights.
Sending a Claim Notice
Before beginning an arbitration, you and we agree to send a written notice (a claim notice) to each party against whom a claim is asserted, in order to provide an opportunity to resolve the claim informally. The claim notice must describe the claim and state the specific relief demanded. Notice to you may be provided electronically or to your billing address, where applicable. Notice to us must include your name, address, My Sheetz Rewardz Card membership number, if applicable, and be sent to General Counsel, Sheetz Legal Department, 5700 Sixth Ave. Altoona, PA 16602.
Limitations on Arbitration
Any arbitration will be arbitrated on an individual basis. There will be no right or authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other My Sheetz Rewardz Card members, other users of the Sites, including other mobile application account holders or users, or other persons similarly situated.
The arbitrator's authority is limited to claims between you and us alone. Claims may not be joined or consolidated unless you and we agree in writing. An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it will apply only to the specific case and cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award.
Arbitration Procedures
This Arbitration provision is governed by the FAA. The arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law, statutes of limitation and privileges.
At any party's request, the arbitrator will provide a brief written explanation of the award. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA; however, any party will have 30 days to appeal the award by notifying the arbitration organization and all parties in writing. The organization will appoint a three-arbitrator panel to decide anew, by majority vote based on written submissions, any aspect of the decision objected to. Judgment upon any award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
Arbitration Fees and Costs
You will be responsible for paying your share of any arbitration fees (including filing, administrative, hearing or other fees).
Continuation
This Arbitration provision will survive termination of your My Sheetz Rewardz Card membership, mobile application account or use, any legal proceeding, and any bankruptcy. If any portion of this Claims Resolution section is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the remaining portions of this Claims Resolution section.
Injunctive Relief
You acknowledge and agree that any breach of the Terms of Use by you is likely to cause Sheetz irreparable harm for which damages will not be an adequate remedy, and that Sheetz will, therefore, be entitled to temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief, without prejudice or waiver of any other right or remedy.
Termination
Notwithstanding any of these Terms of Use, Sheetz reserves the right, without notice and in its sole discretion, to terminate your license to use the Sites and to block or prevent your future access to, and use of, the Sites.
Severability
If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law in any jurisdiction, the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions thereof shall be unaffected and such holding shall not affect the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. To the extent that any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be invalid or unenforceable because it is overbroad, that provision shall not be void but rather shall be limited only to the extent required by applicable law and enforced as so limited.
Waiver
Any waiver by Sheetz of the provisions of these Terms of Use or its rights or remedies under the terms herein must be in writing to be effective. Failure or delay by Sheetz to enforce the provisions of these Terms of Use or its rights or remedies hereunder at any time will not be construed and will not be deemed to be a waiver of its rights under these Terms of Use and will not in any way affect the validity of the whole or any part of these Terms of Use or prejudice Sheetz' right to take subsequent action.
Successors and Assignment
These Terms of Use are binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of both parties and their respective successors, heirs, executors, administrators, personal representatives, and permitted assigns. You may not assign, in whole or in part, these Terms of Use without Sheetz' written consent.
Incorporation of Related Terms
For AppleÂ® Devices (iOS), these Terms incorporate and supplement the Apple, Inc. ("Apple") Terms and Conditions (currently available at http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/us/terms.html#service), including without limitation the Licensed Application End User Agreement therein ("Apple Terms").
