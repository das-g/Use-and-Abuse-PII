Walmart.com Terms of Use
Last Updated May 28, 2021
Please review these Terms of Use carefully.
IMPORTANT: THESE TERMS OF USE CONTAIN A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT, AS FURTHER SET FORTH IN SECTION 20 BELOW, REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. THIS MEANS THAT YOU AND THE WALMART ENTITIES ARE EACH GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO SUE EACH OTHER IN COURT OR IN CLASS ACTIONS OF ANY KIND. IN ARBITRATION, THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY AND THERE IS LESS DISCOVERY AND APPELLATE REVIEW THAN IN COURT.
1. Introduction
Welcome to the family of websites and applications provided by Walmart. These Terms of Use govern your access to and use of all Walmart Sites among other things. By using the Walmart Sites, you affirm that you are of legal age to enter into these Terms of Use, or, if you are not, that you have obtained parental or guardian consent to enter into these Terms of Use and your parent or guardian consents to these Terms of Use on your behalf. If you violate or do not agree to these Terms of Use, then your access to and use of the Walmart Sites is unauthorized. Additional terms and conditions apply to some services offered on the Walmart Sites (e.g., Walmart Pharmacy, Walmart +, and Gift Cards) or through other channels. Those terms and conditions can be found where the relevant service is offered on the Walmart Sites or otherwise and are incorporated into these Terms of Use by reference.
DEFINED TERMS: In these Terms of Use:

(Your feedback is a big part of what helps Walmart to get better at helping you!)
NO MATERIALS RELATED TO HEALTH, WELLNESS, PRESCRIPTIONS, OR PHARMACEUTICALS ARE INTENDED TO SUBSTITUTE FOR THE DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND ADVICE OF A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL, AND SUCH MATERIALS DO NOT COVER ALL POSSIBLE USES, PRECAUTIONS, SIDE EFFECTS, AND INTERACTIONS, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED TO INDICATE THAT ANY DRUG IS SAFE OR EFFECTIVE FOR YOU. CONSULT THE PRODUCT INFORMATION (INCLUDING PACKAGE INSERTS) REGARDING DOSAGE, PRECAUTIONS, WARNINGS, AND INTERACTIONS, AND YOUR MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL, FOR GUIDANCE BEFORE USING ANY PRESCRIPTION OR OVER-THE-COUNTER DRUG.
THE WALMART ENTITIES ASSUME NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY CONSEQUENCE RELATING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO ANY ACTION OR INACTION YOU TAKE BASED ON THE MATERIALS.
6. Merchandise
The Sites may make available listings, descriptions, and images of goods and services (collectively, “Products”). Such Products may be made available by us or by third parties. We make no representations as to the completeness, accuracy, reliability, validity, or timeliness of such listings, descriptions, or images (including any features, specifications, and prices contained on the Sites). Such information and the availability of any Product are subject to change at any time without notice.
We have made efforts to accurately display the attributes of Products, including the applicable colors. However, as the actual colors you see will depend on your monitor, we cannot guarantee that your monitor's display of any color will accurately reflect actual product color or finish. In addition, certain weights, measures, and similar descriptions are approximate and are for convenience only.
We sell Products for children’s use; however, these Products are intended for sale to adults.
Walmart has no liability to you for content on the Walmart Sites that you find to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable. Certain videos, movies, TV programs, video games, computer games, and other Products are labeled with age restrictions or are intended for individuals of certain ages or “mature audiences” only. By ordering an age restricted item, you certify that you satisfy the age restrictions.
Walmart is not responsible for, and cannot guarantee the performance of, goods and services provided by third parties, including any Walmart Entity, Marketplace Retailer (as defined below in Section 16.A), our advertisers, or other third parties to whose sites we link. While our goal is to provide accurate information, product packaging and material may contain more and/or different information than that provided on Walmart Sites, including the product description, country of origin, nutrition, ingredient, allergen, and other information. Always read labels, warnings, directions, and other information provided with the product before using or consuming the product. For additional information about a product, please contact the manufacturer. Information and statements regarding dietary supplements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or health condition. If you find a product is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition (excluding products that are not eligible for return), in accordance with Walmart’s return policy. It is your responsibility to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state, federal, and foreign laws (including minimum age requirements) regarding the purchase, possession, and use of any Product.
7. Third Party Sites
References on Walmart Sites to any names, marks, products, or services of third parties, or links to third-party sites or information, are not an endorsement, sponsorship, or recommendation of the third party or its information, products, or services. Walmart is not responsible for the content of any third-party linked site or any link contained in a linked site, including any third-party social media or mobile app platform with which the Walmart Sites operate or otherwise interact, nor is Walmart responsible for the acts or omissions of any operator of any such site or platform. Your use of any such third-party site or platform is at your own risk, and will be governed by such third party's terms and policies (including its privacy policy).
8. Placing an Order
A. Order Acceptance and Billing
You represent and warrant that you have the right to use any credit card or other means of payment that you provide to us. By providing payment card information to us, you authorize us to store and use the card as a payment method for purchases made through your Walmart.com account, including on Walmart affiliated sites and properties which you access via your Walmart.com account credentials. Walmart participates in account update services offered by some banks. If your bank participates in account updater services, these services will automatically update your card number or expiration date in our system when it changes. If you do not want to have your cards automatically updated, you can opt out of these services by contacting your issuing bank. All billing information you provide to us must be truthful and accurate. Providing any untruthful or inaccurate information is a breach of these Terms of Use and may result in cancellation of your order. Prior to accepting an order we may also request additional information from you. Verification of information may be required prior to the acknowledgment or completion of any purchase. We reserve the right to refuse or cancel an order for any reason including limitations on quantities available for purchase, inaccuracies, or errors in product or pricing information, or problems identified by our credit and fraud avoidance department. If your order is canceled after your credit card (or other payment account) has been charged, we will issue a credit to your credit card (or other applicable payment account) in the amount of the charge. We will attempt to contact you if all or any portion of your order is canceled or if additional information is required to accept your order. Walmart may request a pre-authorization for some orders placed online with a credit or debit card. This pre-authorization will not be billed to you; however, your card issuer may hold this amount for a short period. Your card issuer determines the length of time the pre-authorization is held. We do this to ensure that the card details are still valid and that you have sufficient funds to complete the transaction.
By confirming your purchase at the end of the checkout process, you agree to accept and pay for the Products, as well as all shipping and handling charges and applicable taxes. You will not be charged for most orders until the order has shipped. Some exceptions (when you will be charged at the time your order is placed) are: (i) orders or preorders paid for with a Gift Card, eGift Card, or PayPal account; and (ii) orders paid using the in-store “Cash” payment method.
Walmart reserves the right, including without prior notice, to limit the quantity of items purchased per person, per household, or per order for any reason. We will attempt to notify you should such limits be applied. Walmart also reserves the right, at our sole discretion, to prohibit sales to dealers or resellers. For purposes of these Terms of Use, “reselling” will be defined as purchasing or intending to purchase any Product(s) from Walmart for the purpose of engaging in a commercial sale of the same Product(s) to a third party.
In addition to any other remedies available to it, Walmart may in its sole discretion restrict or terminate your account, or cancel or refuse orders for violations of, or abuse of the Walmart returns policy.
B. Pricing Information; Availability
Walmart cannot confirm the price or availability of an item until after your order is placed. Pricing or availability errors may occur on the Walmart Sites or through Marketplace Retailers. The receipt of an order confirmation does not constitute our acceptance of an order or our confirmation of an offer to sell a Product. Walmart reserves the right to cancel any orders containing pricing or availability errors, with no further obligations to you, even after your receipt of an order confirmation or shipping notice from Walmart. Walmart may, at its discretion, either contact you for instructions or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. Pricing for products may be different on the Walmart Sites or from prices available in Walmart stores or on Walmart Apps.
C. Promotional Codes
Promotional codes are limited in nature and may expire or be discontinued with or without notice. Promotional codes are void where prohibited by law. Promotional codes may not be copied, sold, or otherwise transferred. They are not redeemable for cash and are subject to cancellation or change at any time for any reason without notice. We reserve the right in our discretion to impose conditions on the offering of any promotional code.
D. Gift Cards
The risk of loss and title to any gift cards passes to the purchaser upon our electronic transmission to the recipient or delivery to the carrier, whichever is applicable. Your purchase and use of gift cards is subject to the full terms and conditions related to gift cards, available at https://walmart.com/help/article/Gift-Card-Terms-and-Conditions/9881a4e10ab24dbe8f406df5c75acefd.
9. Shipping and Delivery
Products will be shipped to an address designated by you, if applicable, so long as such address is complete and complies with the shipping restrictions contained on the Walmart Sites. All transactions are made pursuant to a shipping contract, and, as a result, risk of loss and title for Products pass to you upon delivery of the Products to the carrier.
Delivery of Products purchased from the Walmart Sites to addresses outside the United States is limited. Some Products also have restricted delivery within the United States. Delivery restrictions are available at https://www.walmart.com/help/channel/shipping-delivery-pickup/15a9c7156d454a4084a6696cd12dfb09. Some Products may be available for pick up at physical Walmart store locations. Estimated delivery times are determined based on the method of shipping chosen when Products are purchased and the destination of the Products.
10. Export Policy
You acknowledge that (a) goods licensed or sold on the Walmart Sites, and (b) any software or technology purchased, downloaded, or used from the Walmart Sites, are subject to the customs and export control laws and regulations of the United States of America and may also be subject to the customs and export laws and regulations of the country in which the products are manufactured and/or received, and you agree to comply with all applicable laws. You agree, represent, and warrant that no Materials will be accessed from, downloaded in, released in, carried to, transferred to, transshipped through, exported to, or re-exported (collectively “transferred”) to any territory (or national resident thereof), person, entity, or organization to which such Materials could not be transferred directly from the United States or by a U.S. person without a license, including without limitation to any person on the U.S. Treasury Department’s List of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Denied Persons List or Entity List.
11. Intellectual Property
The Walmart Sites and all Materials, and all copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, and other intellectual property rights there (collectively, the “IP”) are owned or controlled by or licensed to Walmart, and are protected by U.S. and international trademark, copyright, and other intellectual property laws. Materials are licensed (not sold) to end users. Subject to your compliance with these Terms of Use, and solely for so long as you are permitted by Walmart to use the Walmart Sites, you may access, view, download, and print the Materials for your personal, non-commercial use only; provided, however, that you (1) retain all copyright, trademark, or other proprietary designations contained on all Materials; (2) do not modify or alter the Materials in any way; and (3) do not provide or make available the Materials to any third party in a commercial manner. In addition, subject to your compliance with these Terms of Use, and solely for so long as you are permitted by Walmart to use the Walmart Apps, we permit you, on a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable basis, to install and use the Walmart Apps on a mobile device that you own or control, solely for your personal, non-commercial use. If you fail to comply with any of the terms or conditions of these Terms of Use, you must immediately cease using the Walmart Apps and remove (that is, uninstall and delete) the Walmart Apps from your mobile device.
No license, right, title, or interest in the Walmart Sites or any Materials is transferred to you as a result of your use of the Walmart Sites or your accessing, viewing, downloading, or printing of the Materials. You may not reproduce (except as noted above), publish, transmit, distribute, display, modify, create derivative works from, sell, or participate in any sale of or exploit in any way, in whole or in part, any of the Materials or the Walmart Sites. The Walmart Sites and Materials may be used only as a personal shopping resource. Any other use, including the reproduction, modification, distribution, transmission, republication, display, or performance, of the Walmart Sites and the Materials is strictly prohibited. The compilation (meaning the collection, arrangement, and assembly) of the Walmart Sites and Materials is the exclusive property of Walmart and is also protected by U.S. and international copyright laws.
WALMART, WAL-MART, the WALMART.COM names and logos, and all other graphics, logos, page headers, button icons, scripts, and service names included in or made available through any of the Walmart Sites are trademarks or trade dress of Walmart in the U.S. and other countries. All other marks are the property of their respective companies.
12. Procedure for Making a Claim of Copyright Infringement
We respect the intellectual property of others. If you believe that your work has been copied and is accessible on the Walmart Sites in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please see our DMCA Procedure (available at https://walmart.com/help/article/Claims-of-Intellectual-Property-Infringement/9b5c2e81943544c5aad0d446b2456fe1) for instructions on how to contact us to report possible copyright infringement.
13. Privacy
You acknowledge that any personal information that you provide through the Walmart Sites will be used by Walmart in accordance with Walmart’s Privacy Policy (available at http://corporate.walmart.com/privacy-security/walmart-privacy-policy), which may be updated by Walmart from time to time. If you purchase an item on Walmart.com sold by a Marketplace Retailer or a Walmart supplier, Walmart may share certain information with that Marketplace Retailer or supplier to permit the Marketplace Retailer or supplier, as applicable, to fulfill and ship your order, process returns, and provide customer service.
You authorize your wireless operator (AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, US Cellular, Verizon, or any other branded wireless operator) to disclose to Walmart and its third-party service providers your mobile number, name, address, email, network status, customer type, customer role, billing type, mobile device identifiers (IMSI and IMEI) and other subscriber status and device details, if available, solely to verify your identity and prevent fraud for the duration of the business relationship. See the Walmart Privacy Policy for how Walmart treats your data.
14. Third-Party Software & Licensing Notices
The Walmart Sites may include certain third-party technologies and open source materials (collectively, “Third-Party Technology”). Your use of such Third-Party Technology is subject to these Terms of Use, as well as well the applicable terms and conditions of such third parties, set forth at https://walmart.com/help/article/Third-party-Software-and-Licensing-Notices/6fa4d4a274334a6699291c1f6723408b which is incorporated in these Terms of Use by reference.
15. Promotions
Any sweepstakes, contests, raffles, surveys, games, or similar promotions (collectively, “Promotions”) made available through the Walmart Sites may be governed by rules that are separate from or supplement these Terms of Use. If you participate in any Promotions, please review the applicable rules as well as our Privacy Policy. If the rules for a Promotion conflict with these Terms of Use, the Promotion rules will govern.
16. Terms Applicable to Special Walmart Services
A. Walmart Marketplace
Walmart operates an online marketplace program on the Walmart Sites (available at https://marketplace.walmart.com/) which enables Marketplace Retailers to sell their products alongside Walmart products and, once an order is placed, to ship such Marketplace Retailers’ products directly to the customer (the “Walmart Marketplace”). Any use of the Walmart Marketplace is subject to the following additional terms:
When we say “Marketplace Retailer,” we mean any entity or retailer that sells goods or services in the Walmart Marketplace through the Walmart Sites, uses any order processing, fulfillment, shipping, or other services related to the Walmart Marketplace provided by or for Walmart, or uses any platform, portal, web service, application, interface, or other tool provided by or for Walmart in connection with the Walmart Marketplace.
By purchasing a product from any of our Marketplace Retailers, you acknowledge that all Walmart Marketplace orders will be fulfilled by the third party Marketplace Retailer and not Walmart. The Marketplace Retailer (and not Walmart) will be responsible for all processing, shipping, returns, and customer service related to your Walmart Marketplace order. Products purchased from a Marketplace Retailer can only be returned to that Marketplace Retailer in accordance with its return policy. Each Marketplace Retailer’s shipping information, return policy, customer service information, and Marketplace Privacy Policy can be found on that Marketplace Retailer’s Seller Information page. For other terms that apply to Walmart Marketplace, including important notices and disclosures, see About Marketplace.
To the fullest extent provided by applicable law, Walmart has no responsibility or liability for any Marketplace Retailer, their products, or representations.
B. iOS Walmart App
In addition to your agreement with these Terms of Use, the following provisions apply with respect to your use of any version of the Walmart App compatible with the iOS operating system of Apple Inc. (“Apple”):
Apple is not a party to these Terms of Use and does not own and is not responsible for any Walmart App. Apple is not providing any warranty for the Walmart App except, if applicable, to refund the purchase price for it. Apple is not responsible for maintenance or other support services for the Walmart App and will not be responsible for any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, or expenses with respect to the Walmart App, including any third-party product liability claims, claims that the Walmart App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement, claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation, and claims with respect to intellectual property infringement. Any inquiries or complaints relating to the use of the Walmart App, including those pertaining to intellectual property rights, must be directed to Walmart in accordance with the “How to Contact Us” section.
The license you have been granted in these Terms of Use is limited to a non-transferable license to use the Walmart App on an Apple-branded product that runs Apple’s iOS operating system and is owned or controlled by you, or as otherwise permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in Apple’s App Store Terms of Service. In addition, you must comply with the terms of any third-party agreement applicable to you when using the Walmart App, such as your wireless data service agreement.
You represent and warrant that (1) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (2) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.
Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms of Use and, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of these Terms of Use, will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms of Use against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof; notwithstanding the foregoing, Walmart’s right to enter into, rescind or terminate any variation, waiver, or settlement under these Terms of Use is not subject to the consent of any third party.
C. Walmart Pay
“Walmart Pay” is a feature built into the Walmart App that allows you to use your smartphone to pay for in-store purchases. Any use of the Walmart Pay service is subject to the following additional terms:
By using Walmart Pay or otherwise by agreeing to these Terms of Use, you agree to receive an eReceipt in lieu of a paper receipt for all purchases made through Walmart Pay. You must register through a Walmart.com account to receive eReceipts (see below for more information).

E. Walmart Pickup and Delivery (formerly, Online Grocery Services)
Use of Walmart Pickup and delivery is subject to the following additional terms:
i. Orders
Once you have placed an order for Walmart Pickup and delivery, we will send you an order acknowledgment by email setting out what you have ordered. This is not an order confirmation or acceptance from us.
There may be a minimum order value, which may change from time to time. In addition to the price of goods, a delivery charge as shown at checkout, if applicable, will also be payable by you. All prices quoted are exclusive of tax and you will see estimated taxes and fees when you place the order. The final taxes and fees will be calculated on the day your order is picked and delivered, or picked up, as applicable. In the event your order must be fulfilled using products of different weight or volume than what you ordered, you will be charged only for the actual weight or volume delivered.
Due to shipment and delivery times, there are limitations on when changes or cancellations to orders can be made. These limitations will be provided when you place your order. For Pickup and delivery orders that are delivered to you, title to the goods purchased by you and the related risk of loss on these items passes to you upon delivery of the items to the carrier.
We may, in our discretion, provide you with a refund in certain circumstances. If you are not satisfied with your order, please contact the Walmart Pickup and delivery Contact Center at 1-800-924-9206.
We will not provide you a refund for certain goods which by nature cannot be returned. Such items include items which cannot be resold for health and hygiene reasons once unwrapped (for example body jewelry, mattresses, bedding, certain items of clothing, personal grooming products, medicines, and certain baby products, etc.).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, all refunds will be subject to our discretion.
We aim to deliver your goods within the delivery or pickup window you selected when placing your order, but do not guarantee that goods will be delivered or available for pickup on or by a certain date. Walmart will not be liable for delivering the goods outside of the requested delivery or pickup slot or failing to deliver or make available for pickup all or any of the goods in your order.
We can only deliver to an address stored in your address book in your account.
ii. Walmart Pickup and delivery Pricing
Pricing for Walmart Pickup and delivery items will be the same prices as if you shopped in the store that packs and delivers the items. If an item's price changes between the time you place your order and the day your order is packed for delivery, we will charge you the lower price. If you have chosen to allow substitutions for your order, and substitutions are made, you will also be charged for the lower priced item. Please note that due to differences in distribution, regional competition, and other factors, prices may vary between stores, and so the prices you see online may not match all stores, only the store where your order is packed. Walmart Pickup and delivery does not match prices from other online or physical stores, or Walmart stores other than the one where your items are picked and packed.
iii. Walmart Pickup and delivery Promotion Codes
Walmart Pickup and delivery Promotion Codes (“Grocery Promo Codes”) are valid only on orders placed for Walmart online grocery services, subject to the terms of this Section. Your use of a Grocery Promo Code indicates your agreement to be bound by these Terms of Use and any Grocery Promo Code terms on the promotion offer itself. Walmart will only honor a Grocery Promo Code if it is used in accordance with all applicable terms.
Only promotional codes issued by Walmart can be used for Walmart Pickup and delivery services. Grocery Promo Codes cannot be used in Walmart stores. Grocery Promo Codes issued by Walmart are, and will remain, the property of Walmart and are not transferable, cannot be resold, and have no cash value unless otherwise stated. Grocery Promo Codes may not be used for alcohol purchases.
Grocery Promo Codes can be added to your Walmart Pickup and delivery order by entering the code at checkout or by selecting a saved offer in checkout. To apply a Grocery Promo Code to your order, you must select it in the “Review Order” section at checkout. Use of a Grocery Promo Code may be subject to you providing proof of entitlement to use the Grocery Promo Code.
All Grocery Promo Codes have an expiration date after which they cannot be used for any order. Grocery Promo Code values may be adjusted if the total discount value is greater than the value of your order.
We reserve the right to withdraw or cancel any Grocery Promo Code at any time, either as a whole, or for specific goods or delivery areas. If this happens, then the Grocery Promo Codes may not be used for any orders placed after the date of withdrawal or cancellation. We reserve the right to reject or cancel the use of a Grocery Promo Code where fraud or misuse is suspected. You will have no claim against Walmart in connection with such rejection or cancellation of a Grocery Promo Code. Walmart will not be liable to any customer or household for any financial loss arising out of the cancellation or withdrawal of any Grocery Promo Code or any failure or inability of a customer to use a Grocery Promo Code for any reason.
Grocery Promo Codes may not be copied, reproduced, published, or distributed directly or indirectly in any form for use by anyone other than the original recipient. By using a Grocery Promo Code, you warrant that you are the duly authorized recipient of it.

However, by uploading Photos into your Walmart Digital Photo Center Account, you agree to waive all moral rights to those images. In addition, you grant to Walmart a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable license, so we can download, upload, copy, print, display, reproduce, modify, publish, post, transmit, distribute, and otherwise make available the photos included in your Walmart Digital Photo Center Account for the following purposes: (1) displaying displaying Photos to the people you select; (2) fulfilling orders; (3) improving the Walmart Digital Photo Center service and enabling it to work as designed, including by using automated systems and algorithms to analyze and customize your Photos; and (4) developing new technologies and services for Walmart. We will not use or modify your Photos for any purposes other than the foregoing without obtaining your express permission.
You are responsible for monitoring and creating backup copies of the Photos stored in your account. Walmart Digital Photo Center is not provided to you under any warranty. Walmart will not be liable for any damage to your photos, albums, rolls, or uploads, including but not limited to loss, deletion or alteration.
Walmart may terminate your service or access to the Walmart Digital Photo Center and delete any and all information, including but not limited to your Photos, without notice, for any reason including, but not limited to (1) your violation of these Terms of Use or other policies set by Walmart elsewhere on the Walmart Sites; (2) online conduct that Walmart believes is harmful to other customers, the business of Walmart, or other third-party information providers; and (3) failure to access your account for one (1) year.
Walmart reserves the right to disclose any Photos made available by you or any other customers as necessary to satisfy any law, regulation, or governmental request, or to edit, refuse to submit or to remove any Photos, in whole or in part, that in Walmart’s judgment are unsuitable or in violation of these Terms of Use or other policy set by Walmart elsewhere on the Walmart Sites. Walmart may delete, move, and edit Photos for any reason, at any time, without notice.

Walmart reserves the right to require that you obtain a signed copyright release form from the photographer or studio for photographs that are signed, stamped, or otherwise identified by any photographer or studio as copyrighted material, or any photograph that appears to have been taken by a professional photographer or studio, even if it is not marked with any sort of copyright. In such cases, negatives or digital images of a copyrighted image will be returned to you unprinted and you will be provided instructions on how to present Walmart with a signed copyright release. Copyright owner release forms and copyright permission release forms are available in-store at the Walmart Digital Photo Center.
Walmart will not assist in the copying of any state or federal document, including but not limited to driver's licenses, passports, and social security cards.

To use such software, you will agree to the terms and conditions imposed by the third party provider. Unless otherwise stated in any specific agreement, the agreement to use such software will be solely between you and the third party provider.
Walmart uses commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the availability of the Walmart Digital Photo Center 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and provide photo processing within the time frame communicated to you. However, Walmart will not be liable to you for any unexpected outage or disruption of service. One-hour photo services are subject to limitations on store equipment and processing capacity, and actual pick-up times may vary.
Making available any Photos to Walmart for processing, printing, storage, transmission or other handling constitutes an agreement by you that any damage to your Photos or computer system, or any loss of data, by Walmart, its subsidiaries, employees, or agents, even if caused by negligence or other fault, will only entitle you to replacement with a like amount of storage and processing. Except for replacement, to the fullest extent provided by applicable law, the handling of any Photos is not under warranty or liability, and recovery for any incidental or consequential damages is excluded.
You understand and agree that any Content, including but not limited to Photos and software, downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of the Walmart Digital Photo Center is done at your own discretion and risk and that you will be solely responsible for any damages to your computer system or loss of data that may result in the download or upload of such material.

Charities must promptly update their List Address (and any other information requested by Walmart) if the Charity address changes or it ceases holding a valid ownership or leasehold interest in the List Address.

Please read it carefully as it provides that you and Walmart will waive any right to file a lawsuit in court or participate in a class action for matters within the terms of the Arbitration provision.
EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES THAT QUALIFY FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT, ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OF USE OR ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND WALMART, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF IN A COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY, AND YOU AGREE THAT WALMART AND YOU ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND TO HAVE A TRIAL BY A JURY. YOU AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED AND YOU ARE AGREEING TO GIVE UP THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. The arbitration will be administered by Judicial Arbitration Mediation Services, Inc.

The JAMS Rules, including instructions for bringing arbitration, are available on the JAMS website at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration. The Minimum Standards are available at http://www.jamsadr.com/consumer-arbitration.

Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by JAMS or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will follow the terms of these Terms of Use and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of these Terms of Use, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

22. General
These Terms of Use represent the complete agreement and understanding between you and Walmart and supersede all prior agreements and representations between the parties with respect to the subject matter of these Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not, and shall not be construed to, create any partnership, joint venture, employer-employee, agency, or franchisor-franchisee relationship between you and Walmart. Headings used in these Terms of Use are for reference purposes only and in no way define or limit the scope of the section. If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision will be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable and the other terms of these Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect.

We may assign, transfer, or sublicense any or all of our rights or obligations under these Terms of Use without restriction.
