USE OF THE PLATFORM
The following requirements apply to your use of the Platform:
You will not use any electronic communication feature of the Platform for any purpose that is unlawful, harmful, tortuous, defamatory, libelous, obscene, invasive of the privacy of another person, threatening, harassing, abusive, hateful, racist, infringing, pornographic, incites criminal or abusive acts, or is otherwise objectionable or inappropriate as determined by Taco Bell.
You will not upload, post, reproduce, or distribute any information, software, or other material protected by copyright or any other intellectual property right (as well as rights of publicity and privacy) without first obtaining the permission of the owner of such rights.
You will not collect or store personal data about other users.
You will not use the Platform for any commercial purpose not expressly approved by Taco Bell in writing.
You will not upload, transmit, email, post, or otherwise communicate any advertising or promotional materials, including without limitation, “junk mail,” “surveys,” “spam,” “chain letters,” “pyramid schemes,” or any other form of solicitation or unauthorized communication, including but not limited to any content that contains business solicitation of any type, including advertising a product or service, offering a product or service for sale, or directing readers to a location for more information about a product or service.
You will not upload, post, email, include in any Messages (as hereafter defined) or otherwise transmit any material that contains viruses, corrupted files, software, links to other sites or any other computer code, files, or programs which might adversely affect, interrupt, limit, or interfere with the functionality of Taco Bell’s system or any third party’s computer. You further agree that you will not share or post any content that undermines the operation of the Platform, a message board, chat room, forum or other feature.
By displaying, publishing, or otherwise posting any content on or through the Platform and/or providing Taco Bell with any such content, you hereby grant Taco Bell a non-exclusive, sub-licensable, worldwide, fully-paid, royalty free license to use, modify, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, and distribute such content in any and all media now known or hereinafter developed without the requirement to make payment to you or to any third party or the need to seek any third party permission.

BINDING ARBITRATION
Agree that any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Platform, use of the Platform, participation in any Services, this Agreement and/or the Privacy Policy shall be settled by binding arbitration in a location determined by the arbitrator as set forth herein (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you), or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties, in accordance with the applicable procedural rules set forth in the then prevailing Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS (“JAMS Rules and Procedures”), and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The JAMS Rules and Procedures are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling (800) 352-5267. The arbitrator shall be selected pursuant to the JAMS Rules and Procedures. Alternatively, you may assert your claims in small claims court in accordance with the terms of this Agreement if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The arbitrator shall apply California law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law. If you initiate arbitration against Taco Bell, you will not be responsible for professional fees for the arbitrator’s services or any other JAMS fees. In the event that the claimant is able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be cost-prohibitive or greater than the costs of litigation, Taco Bell will pay as much of the claimant’s filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive or more expensive than the cost of litigation. If any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal (other than that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis), or otherwise conflicts with the rules and procedures established by JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, the portion that is deemed invalid, unenforceable or illegal is that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither claimant nor Taco Bell shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute. THE ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PURSUANT TO THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL BE IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN THE CLAIMS OF OTHER PERSONS OR PARTIES WHO MAY BE SIMILARLY SITUATED.
No Illegal, Infringing or Abusive Message Content: You understand and acknowledge that you are responsible for the content of your Messages, and agree not to include anything that is unlawful, harmful, tortuous, defamatory, libelous, obscene, invasive of the privacy of another person, threatening, harassing, abusive, hateful, racist, infringing, pornographic, incites criminal or abusive acts, or is otherwise objectionable or inappropriate as determined by Taco Bell.
 
BY AGREEING TO THE ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES AS SET FORTH HEREIN, YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND LIMITING YOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL. DO NOT USE THIS PLATFORM IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE FOREGOING BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISIONS.

Eligibility
Participation in the Program is open to legal residents of the fifty (50) United States and the District of Columbia, who are age sixteen (16) years of age or older, and who have created a Taco Bell account, all at the time of purchase. The Program is not targeted towards and is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 16. If you are between the age of 16 and 18, you may only accrue Points and use Rewards under the supervision of your parent or legal guardian, who agrees to be bound by these Program Terms.
 
Participation
Except as otherwise communicated by Taco Bell from time to time, to participate in the Program, you must have the Taco Bell Mobile App and a Taco Bell account (you can create one for free using the Mobile App or on tacobell.com) (“Account”). Limit: one (1) Account per person/email address, regardless of whether more than one person uses the same email address. Taco Bell may revise the methods in which a consumer can create an Account at any time. During the term of the Program (as determined by Taco Bell in Taco Bell’s sole discretion), when you log into your Account using the Mobile App (or such other channels as may be designed by Taco Bell in the future), after agreeing to this Agreement (including these Program Terms), you will be enrolled in the Program. Upon successful login to your Account on the Mobile App (or such other channels as may be designated by Taco Bell in the future), your loyalty account (“Loyalty Account”) will automatically be established. You acknowledge and agree that Taco Bell may send you information and notices regarding your Loyalty Account and the Program by email, push notification, or other means based on the information you provide to Taco Bell. You acknowledge and agree that Taco Bell shall have no liability associated with or arising from your failure to maintain accurate Account information, including, but not limited to, your failure to receive critical information about the Program.
 
Earning Points
At the start of the Program, only designated qualifying food and beverages purchases made through your Account on the Mobile App for in-store pickup, drive-thru, or curbside pickup may be deemed “Qualifying Purchases” and eligible for the accrual of Program points (“Points”). At any time, Taco Bell may add, eliminate, or otherwise change the methods of pickup that qualify as “Qualifying Purchases.” You must check-in at the participating location by selecting “Curbside,” “Drive-Thru,” or “In-Store”/“In-Restaurant” (or such other check-in method as may be designated by Taco Bell from time to time) for any purchase to constitute a “Qualifying Purchase.” No partial Points will be awarded. For the avoidance of doubt, taxes and purchases of merchandise, alcohol, charity donations, gift cards, and delivery orders will not constitute Qualifying Purchases hereunder unless otherwise expressly designated by Taco Bell.
Once you complete your Program enrollment, you will start earning Points for Qualifying Purchases. After you check-in for a Qualifying Purchase, please allow up to forty-eight (48) hours for Points to be deposited into your Loyalty Account. Taco Bell will not be liable for any failure to credit Points in a timely manner.
For eligible Mobile App users with Accounts established prior to the start of the Program, you will earn Points for your Qualifying Purchases beginning on the date that the Program is first available to you in your Mobile App, once you have agreed to the Program Terms. Purchases made before such date shall not constitute Qualifying Purchases. Purchases made before you agree to the Program Terms shall not constitute Qualifying Purchases. You will earn the number of Points for each Qualifying Purchase as set forth at https://www.tacobell.com/faq/rewards, which is subject to change from time to time in Taco Bell’s sole discretion. Total Point accruals may only be accessible via the Mobile App.
Following the launch of the Program, Taco Bell in its sole discretion may later elect to also permit the earning of Points by making in-store purchases at Taco Bell restaurants. If Taco Bell makes this functionality available, Taco Bell reserves the right to limit such functionality.
From time to time, Taco Bell, or others acting with Taco Bell’s permission, may award additional Points for certain types of Qualifying Purchases or for other reasons for a limited period of time (“Bonus Points”). Bonus Points will contribute towards reaching the Tier Level (as hereafter defined), but Bonus Points may not otherwise qualify for certain Rewards in Taco Bell’s discretion. In such instances, Bonus Points will be awarded/redeemed as described in their promotional offer and will be subject to any additional terms set forth in such promotional offer.
If at any time your Account is not in good standing, no additional Points may accrue with respect to any Qualifying Purchase you make until your Account returns to good standing. Points have no cash or other value and may be used only to obtain Rewards in the Program. Points accrued in your Loyalty Account do not constitute your property and do not entitle a participant to a vested right or interest. Points may be revoked, cancelled, limited, or modified at any time, even though such action may affect your right to use previously accumulated Points. You may not purchase Points or transfer Points from one Loyalty Account to another Loyalty Account. You also may not transfer or sell any Points or your Loyalty Account. Taco Bell is not liable for Points that are lost, suspended, delayed, uncredited, or revoked due to suspected or actual fraudulent, unauthorized, illegitimate, or other unacceptable use.
 
Tier Levels
From time to time, Taco Bell may establish various tier levels in connection with the Program (“Tier Levels”). Except as otherwise determined by Taco Bell in Taco Bell’s sole discretion, each Loyalty Account’s Tier Level is set for a calendar year; at the end of each calendar year (unless you have qualified for a heightened Tier Level for the upcoming year), your Account may be reset to the entry Tier Level. Your Tier Level will be determined by your previous calendar year’s Point accumulation. At the launch of the Program, the Tier Levels are as follows: 1) Hot and 2) Fire. These Tier Levels are subject to change and Taco Bell may increase or decrease the number of Tier Levels and the Points and Rewards that can be earned in each Tier Level, all in its sole discretion. If you earn enough Points to qualify for the next Tier Level, you may be elevated to the next Tier Level for the remainder of the current year and will be elevated for the next calendar year. When you join the Program, your starting Tier Level will be determined by Taco Bell, in its sole discretion.
 
Points Expiration/Forfeiture
All Points will expire six (6) months after the calendar month during which the Points were earned, unless they are converted into a Reward. For example, if you earn 50 Points on April 5, those 50 Points will expire on November 1 if you do not earn a Reward by November 1. Your Points will be forfeited if your Account or Loyalty Account is terminated and/or deleted by you or by Taco Bell. You may not be provided with notice of expiration or forfeiture of Points. You are not entitled to compensation from Taco Bell or from any other entity if your Points expire or are forfeited for any reason.
 
Rewards and Reward Expiration
When two hundred fifty (250) Points (or other amount of required Points as indicated by Taco Bell) are earned within the timeframes set forth herein, those 250 earned Points will automatically convert to a Reward, and the 250 Points shall be deducted from your Loyalty Account and shall no longer be usable for Reward redemption. For the current list and description of the Rewards available at each Tier Level, please visit https://www.tacobell.com/faq/rewards. The selection of available Reward items is determined by Taco Bell and the selection and/or the number of Points needed to earn the Rewards may change from time to time without notice to you. All Rewards are subject to availability and must be redeemed in a US store. Points are only redeemable for Rewards.
For instructions on how to redeem your Reward, read the Frequently Asked Questions available at https://www.tacobell.com/faq/rewards. Limit: One (1) Reward per transaction. Except as otherwise designated by Taco Bell, you may not combine Reward redemption with any other offers. From time to time, Taco Bell may limit the amount of Rewards you can redeem within a specified time period. Rewards and Points are not transferrable, non-divisible, and may not be combined with other Loyalty Program’s accounts. Offline redemption is not currently available; all Points must be redeemed online.
Each Reward may be subject to terms and conditions specific to the Reward. You will be responsible for any cost(s) associated with any customizations, additions, or changes you make to a Reward item, including any sales tax on such changes. Rewards must be redeemed within thirty (30) days of being posted to a Loyalty Account or they will be forfeited. Taco Bell is not liable to you if a Reward expires prior to your use of the Reward. An expired Reward will no longer be available for use or redemption. You can only acquire Rewards to the extent that you have the required number of Points in your Loyalty Account or to the extent Taco Bell elects to offer any other Reward method. You cannot combine Points in one Loyalty Account with Points in other Loyalty Accounts. Once a redemption order is placed or the Reward expires, your Loyalty Account will show a deduction of the Reward. Rewards are subject to availability at participating Taco Bells in the fifty (50) US and D.C.
