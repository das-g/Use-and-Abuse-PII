Privacy Policy
Last updated: October 22, 2020
This Privacy Policy applies to the shopping sites and apps operated by ContextLogic and its corporate affiliates (as defined below), and to any other site or service that is operated by ContextLogic and links to it ("Services"). This Privacy Policy uses the terms "our" "us" and "we" to refer to ContextLogic Inc. or ContextLogic B.V. and "you" or "user(s)" to refer to individuals described by the information that ContextLogic collects and uses, such as consumers and merchants. If you live in Switzerland or the European Economic Area (EEA), your personal data is controlled by ContextLogic B.V., a company based in the Netherlands. Please read this document carefully to learn more about how we collect, use, share and protect information, including information that may describe you personally.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies we don't own or control, or people that we don't manage. For example, it does not apply to the use of purchaser shipping information by a merchant. Any capitalized terms we use in this Privacy Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of Use which govern Your use of the Services.
We operate several marketplaces, including Wish, Geek, Cute, Mama, Home and Joyful Shopping, that allow merchants to list items and users to find and purchase items. We also support referral programs, affiliate offers, and a pickup program. We collect and use information from users (shoppers), merchants (sellers) and pickup program participants to facilitate listing (of items), shopping and fulfillment. We also use information to find items that we think will be of interest to buyers and to find the right price for each item.
By using or accessing the Services, you acknowledge that we will collect, use, and share your information as described in this Privacy Policy. You have choices about whether to provide us with information and how we use that information. You may choose not to provide us with information, but your choice(s) may prevent you from using the Services or limit your use of certain features. For example, if you do not provide us with a payment method, you may not be able to make purchases or if you do not allow us to see your device location we will not be able to recommend items for pickup at a location near you. See Section 7 for more information about your choices.
We're constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to update this Privacy Policy. We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the law, the Services, our companies or advances in technology. We will alert you to a change by placing a notice on the Services or by sending an email. Our use of the information we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used.

1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT & USE
Some of the information we collect is actively provided by you, such as when you fill out a field or form. Some is collected automatically (typically from devices). And some may be collected from other sources.
1.2 Information You Provide
When you use the Services you provide information to us, such as when you create an account or a store, make or fulfill a purchase, leave a review, or request customer support. Examples of the information you may provide are:
Name
Email address
Payment method or payment account
Shipping address or business address, including home addresses (for the pickup program)
Phone number
Password or social network account credentials
Additional verification data, including government identification
1.3 Information We Collect Automatically
When you use the Services, including when you visit our sites or install our apps, we automatically collect information about how you use the Services and the devices you use to access the Services. We may also generate information about you, such as an Account ID number. Examples of the information we collect automatically are:
IP Address
Location information - general location information from your computer or mobile device or precise GPS location information from your mobile device.
Social network account and profile data (when you use social login)
Unique Identifiers, including MAC Address, Ad IDs, and device attributes, such as operating system and browser type, and usage patterns.
Usage Data, such as: web log data, referring and exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages and content viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time you used our Services, the frequency of your use of our Services, error logs, and other similar information.
1.4 Analytics, Advertising & Technical Data
We or our service providers or business partners may collect and use various pieces of information in an automated way to support analytics and advertising operations.
Analytics - We use analytics tools and providers to understand better how individuals and their devices interact with the Services. Google Analytics is important to our analytics - How Google uses data when you visit a partner site or app.
Cookies and Related Technologies - We and others may use cookies, which are text files containing small amounts of information that are downloaded on your device, or related technologies, such as web beacons, local shared objects and tracking pixels to store or collect information ("Cookies"). Cookies can help us and others learn about your online activity including on other sites or services. For example, web beacons allow ad networks to provide aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network's servers, these companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. See our Cookie Policy for additional information.
We do not have access to Cookies placed or read by Advertisers, and this Privacy Policy does not govern the use of those cookies and related technologies. See the Choice information in Section 7 for more information.
1.5 Third-Party Links and Plug-Ins
The Services may have links to third-party websites or apps, which may have privacy policies that differ from our own. We are not responsible for the practices of such sites/apps.
The Services may also offer you the ability to interact with plug-ins from social media sites and others, which may allow us or the social media site to receive data from or about you. If you have previously provided personal information to a third-party operating a plug-in on the Services, then that third-party may recognize you on the Services. Your use of social network plug-ins is subject to the privacy policy of the company that operates the plug-in, which may be different from ours, so please read these policies carefully to understand their policies and your options.
1.6 Other Sources
We may gather information, including demographic and statistical information from third-parties, such as business partners, marketers, researchers, analysts. We may attribute this information to you based on your assignment to certain statistical groups. We may use this information to supplement the other information that we collect in order to derive your possible interests and to provide more relevant experiences for you within the Services and improve our products, analytics, and advertising.
2. HOW WE USE INFORMATION & LAWFUL BASES
2.1 Use
In general, we collect, use and store ("process") your information to provide the Services, to fix and improve the Services, to develop new services, and to market our companies and their products and services. Some specific examples of how we use information are:
Setup and manage accounts, including identification and authentication
Collect or make a payment
Process or support fulfillment of orders
Find or recommend a local feature/service, such as a pickup location
Communicate with you - using email, sms, push notifications or platform messaging (like Whatsapp) - about your account or to market product listings, features, or events
Advertise and market the Services, including in email or other channels
Test changes in the Services and develop new features
Analyze use of the Services and personalize content, including ads and prices
Provide support, including addressing questions and problems users, merchants or pickup locations may have with the Services, or resolving disputes
Prevent, detect, investigate and respond to fraud, unauthorized access/use of the Services, breaches of terms and policies, or other wrongful behavior
Comply with any procedures, laws, and regulations which apply to us, including those that set retention periods
2.2 Lawful Bases (EEA)
Lawfulness of personal data processing is an important principle under EU data protection law. For purposes of European data protection law, we typically process personal data where:
We need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you, such as when we process a payment;
It is in our legitimate interests (or those of a third-party) and your data protection interests and fundamental rights and freedoms do not override those interests, such as when we secure the Services, engage in fraud prevention, and certain direct marketing;
We need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation;
We have your consent to use your personal data.
2.3 Other Uses - Deidentified Data
We may take steps to limit or prevent identification of any particular user or device in sets of data, such as by combining information relating to many individuals ("aggregation") or removing or changing pieces of information about each individual. We may use de-identified data to help support our research and marketing efforts. This Privacy Policy does not apply to our use of such de-identified information.
3. LOCATION OF DATA PROCESSING - UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE
Information that we collect and use may be processed outside of your country or region. When we share personal information with Affiliates or with third-parties in other countries, we apply appropriate safeguards. For example, data covered by European data protection laws is typically protected by EU Model clauses.
By using the Services you:
Acknowledge that your information will be processed as described in this Privacy Policy; and
Consent to having your information transferred to our affiliates and facilities in the United States or elsewhere or to facilities of third-parties with whom we share information as described in this Privacy Policy.
4. RETENTION OF PERSONAL DATA/INFORMATION
We keep your information for the time period required to complete the purposes for which it is processed or satisfy legal retention requirements. The length of time for which we retain information depends on the purposes for which we collected and use it or the requirements of applicable laws.
5. INFORMATION SHARING
We may disclose information about you or your use of the Services with the types of recipients described below.
5.2 Service Providers/Agents
We employ other companies and people to perform tasks or services on our behalf and need to share information with them so they can complete their work. For example: we may use a payment processing company to receive or deliver payments; or we may use a cloud services provider to store data.
5.3 Affiliates
We may share your information with other companies under common ownership or control with ContextLogic Inc. ("Affiliates"). These Affiliates use your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Where such sharing involves a transfer of personal data out of Europe, we use safeguards, including EU Model Clauses, to protect the data and ensure the lawfulness of the transfer.
5.4 Other Users
Information about merchants, pickup locations and users (i.e. purchasers) is shared in certain contexts. For example, merchant store information is made available to users and user reviews of a store are made available to merchants and other users. Also, when users complete a purchase using the Services, we normally share information needed to fulfill the purchase, such as shipping address and phone number, with the merchant (i.e. seller) or its service provider(s), such as a shipping company. Information shared with sellers and their service providers is subject to their own policies.
Certain user profile information, including your name, photo, location, items on your wishlist (unless you make the wishlist private), reviews you have written (including any photo/video you upload with such reviews), and the list of people you follow or that follow you, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services. Your user name may also be displayed to other users if and when you send messages or comments or upload images or videos through the Services and other users can contact you through messages and comments. Use caution and good judgment before sharing personal information in public areas of the Services.
5.5 Advertisers
We may allow advertisers, including merchants ("Advertisers"), to choose groups of users to see their listings, advertisements or promotional offers based on common features of a group of users, such as similar usage patterns or similar geographic locations. For example, if you buy products related to wine, we may show you an offer for a service that sells wine or similar products. If an advertiser asks us to show an ad to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that ad, the advertiser may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach.
5.6 Business Transfers
We may choose to buy or sell assets and may share or transfer user information (including personal information) in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, user information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third-party.
5.7 Legal Requirements, Protection of Wish and Others
We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we in good faith believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of ContextLogic, our employees, our users, or others.
5.8 Consent
We may share your information in other ways if you have asked us to do so or have given consent.
6. SECURITY
6.1 Accounts are protected by a password for your privacy and security. If you access your account via a third-party site or service, such as Facebook, you may have additional or different sign-on protections via that third-party site or service. We recommend that you choose an appropriate password, safeguard your password and limit access to the devices on which you access your account.
6.2 We use reasonable organizational and technical measures intended to protect the privacy of your account and personal information we use or store, but the Internet and our Services are not 100% secure. We cannot guarantee complete privacy or security for the information that you provide or that we collect.

If you are a California resident, you may have certain rights. For more information, see our Supplemental Privacy Notice for California Residents in section 13 below.

"Personally identifiable information" includes first and last name, address, email address, phone number, Social Security Number, or an identifier that allows a specific person to be contacted either physically or online.
We do not engage in such activity; however, if you are a Nevada resident who has purchased or leased goods or services from us, you may submit a request to opt out of any potential future sales under Nevada law by emailing privacy@wish.com. Please note we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity and the authenticity of the request. Once verified, we will maintain your request in the event our practices change.
9. PRIVACY COMPLAINTS
We are committed to resolving valid complaints about your privacy or our collection or use of your personal information. For questions or complaints regarding our data use practices or Privacy Policy, please contact us at privacy@contextlogic.com.
If you are located in Europe (EU/EEA), we consider the Dutch Data Protection Authority to be our lead supervisory authority for the processing or personal data of individuals in Europe. We have appointed a data protection officer ('DPO') for Europe. For questions, complaints, or requests in connection with the processing of your personal data you can contact our DPO at DPO@contextlogic.com. You may also lodge a complaint with the Dutch Data Protection Authority by mail, at Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens, PO Box 93374, 2509 AJ Den Haag, or through their website: https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/en.
10. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
We do not knowingly collect or solicit "personal information" (as defined by the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at privacy@contextlogic.com.
For residents of the EU/EEA where processing of personal data is based on consent, we will not knowingly engage in that processing for users under the age of consent established by applicable member or data protection law.
