24. ARBITRATION
1. Parties
1.1 ContextLogic Inc. and its corporate affiliates: (i) operate online marketplaces, including Wish, Cute, Baby, Mama, Home and Geek ("Marketplace Apps") that may be available as native apps for operating systems like Android or iOS, or on standard or mobile web; (ii) develop and provide other services and products. In this policy we refer to ContextLogic and its corporate affiliates as "ContextLogic" or "we" or "us." We refer to end users as "you" and the entities that list and sell products and services as "Merchant(s)."
1.2 Your location determines the ContextLogic entity with whom you have a contract:
If your habitual residence is in the EEA, you contract with ContextLogic B.V., a Dutch company and the applicable terms are here.
If your habitual residence is in Australia, you are contracting with ContextLogic Australia PT Ltd, an Australian company, and the applicable terms are here.
If your habitual residence is in India, you contract with ContextLogic Information Technology India Private Limited and the applicable terms are here.
If your habitual residence is in Canada, you are contracting with ContextLogic Canada Inc., a Canadian company, and these Terms govern your use of the Services.
If your habitual residence is not in Australia, Canada, the EEA, or India, you are contracting with ContextLogic Inc., a U.S. company, and these Terms govern your use of the Services.
The ContextLogic entity you contract with may change as we expand our business.
1.3 The Marketplace Apps allow sellers ("Merchants") to set up stores that list and sell products and services (“Products”) to end users. When you purchase a Product, the contract for sale is solely between you and the Merchant. That means that when you purchase a Product on Wish or another Marketplace App, your transaction is with the Merchant who listed the Product and the Merchant is responsible for fulfilling your order. ContextLogic provides the technology platform for the Marketplace Apps and acts as a payment collection agent for the Merchant solely for the limited purpose of accepting funds from you, on behalf of the Merchant, upon your purchase of a Product from the Merchant via a Marketplace App.
1.4 Some Products may be available for pickup or receipt at a physical location near you. See the Pickup Policy for additional details and restrictions.
2. Services
2.1 ContextLogic operates marketplaces that allow Merchants and users to share information and complete purchases. Merchants are responsible for their stores, their Products, their Product listings (including any original or strike-through prices), and fulfillment of your order. Merchants may be located in your country or region or elsewhere. If they are located elsewhere, this may have an effect on taxes, customs or the applicability of consumer protection rules.
2.2 Although we are not a party to the contract formed between you and a Merchant when you purchase Products sold by Merchants, we may, in relation to providing our Services or in relation to our role as a limited payment collection agent for Merchant, assist with payment processing, returns, refunds, and other customer service. ContextLogic does not guarantee: (i) the existence, quality, safety, suitability, or legality of Merchant Products or Product listings; (ii) the truth or accuracy of any Product listings, descriptions, or other content provided by Merchants; (iii) the truth or accuracy of ratings, reviews, or other User Submissions; or (iv) the performance or conduct of Merchants or other third parties. Except where we clearly indicate otherwise, ContextLogic does not endorse any Merchant, store, Product, or Product listing. Please read all labels, warnings, and directions provided with a purchased Product before using or receiving it, and consider doing your own research prior to making a purchase.
2.3 You acknowledge and agree that ContextLogic acts as the Merchant’s payment collection agent solely for the limited purpose of accepting payments from you on behalf of the Merchant. Upon your payment of funds to us, your payment obligation to the Merchant for the agreed-upon amount is extinguished, and ContextLogic is responsible for remitting the funds to the Merchant in the manner described in the Merchant Terms of Service and Agreement, which constitutes ContextLogic’s agreement with the Merchant. In the event that ContextLogic does not remit any such amounts, the Merchant will have recourse only against ContextLogic and not you directly.
2.4 Please check all details and any restrictions regarding each Product thoroughly before you place your order with a Merchant. With regard to any requests for services, please note that it is solely your responsibility (or the responsibility of the person receiving the services) to inform the Merchant of any medical or health conditions and/or special needs that may affect or be affected by the services (including, but not limited to, information regarding allergies and health problems).
3. User Requirements

Products for children's use may be sold by Merchants; however, these Products are intended for sale to adults. Certain Products may be intended for individuals of certain ages or "mature audiences" only. By ordering such Products, you certify that you are old enough to view, use, own, or receive them.

5. Privacy
5.1 Our Privacy Policy provides information about how we collect, use, and disclose your personal information. By installing our apps, creating an account, viewing Products, making a purchase, or otherwise using the Services, you acknowledge that we will collect, use, and disclose your personal information as described in our Privacy Policy.
5.2 Your purchases are fulfilled by Merchants. In order to fulfill your purchases, Merchants need information about you, such as your mailing address. Merchants may be located in your country or region or elsewhere. You acknowledge that when you make a purchase, ContextLogic treats it as a request from you to share your information (including your name, street address, and phone number) with the relevant Merchant to, for example facilitate shipping or the provision of Products to you, and that such sharing may cause a transfer of personal data from one region to another.
5.3 You acknowledge and agree that ContextLogic may access, preserve, and disclose your account or user information (if such information exists) as described in our Privacy Policy, including without limitation, if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce these Terms; (c) respond to claims that any of your acts violate the rights of third parties; (d) respond to your requests for customer service; or (e) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of ContextLogic, its users, or the public.

6.2 If you would like to receive marketing via mobile texts and alerts, you may sign up to do so, including on a checkout page for purchasing a Product in the Marketplace Apps. By signing up, you provide your consent to receive recurring autodialed marketing texts or other mobile messages from or on behalf of us at the mobile number you've provided.

If you have any questions, you may reply HELP to Wish sms/text alerts or contact customer care at support@wish.com.
6.3 ContextLogic may route communications with you through a third-party service provider, and we or the service provider may record or monitor telephone conversations you have with ContextLogic or its agents for quality control and training purposes, or for our own protection. You consent to such recording and monitoring. ContextLogic may also track communications between you and Merchants (using a service provider or through other methods) so that ContextLogic and the Merchants can access certain details about your communications with ContextLogic or Merchants. As part of this process, ContextLogic and the service provider will receive and store data about your communication, including the date and time of the communication, your contact information, and the content of the communication. You consent to these practices by ContextLogic and the service provider. The information is subject to our Privacy Policy.

In the event we need to make a change to an order, we will attempt to notify you by contacting the email address, billing address, and/or phone number provided at the time the order was made. Prices are subject to change at any time. Due to separate and applicable tax jurisdictions, your purchases may be subject to specific sales, use, customs, or value-added taxes, and the shipping time and associated cost may increase accordingly.

Please note that VAT, customs duties, and similar charges collected at the time of purchase are estimated values and may be subject to change depending on local laws. If additional amounts are assessed, you are responsible for them. Wish cannot be liable if a Product is delayed or denied customs clearance as a result of your failure to pay such amounts. For more information about VAT, customs duties, and the role of a freight forwarding agent, see our Tax Policy page. When a transaction is made pursuant to a shipping contract, the risk of loss and title for products pass to you upon delivery of the products to the carrier.

Merchants provide the other information in the Product listings, including any reference or strike-through prices. Merchants are obligated to provide accurate information, but we have no way to guarantee the truth or accuracy of information in Product listings. ContextLogic does not represent, warrant, or guarantee that the Merchant actually offered or sold the Product at the strike-through price. You should not rely on the strike-through price in connection with making any decision to purchase. If comparison price is an important factor in your purchasing decision, you should do your own research and comparisons before making a purchase.
14.5 Pricing or availability errors may occur from time to time. ContextLogic reserves the right to cancel any orders containing pricing or availability errors, with no further obligations to you, even after your receipt of an order confirmation or shipping notice. Pricing for Products may be different in different apps or platforms that we operate and also vary based on other factors, including location, time, and purchase patterns.

If you accept a refund, your ability to seek another remedy from the applicable Merchant may be affected.
15.2 Except as described in the Refund & Returns Policy, ContextLogic cannot refund, reimburse, cover, or otherwise be responsible for any fees, including without limitation those not paid to ContextLogic, such as customs, taxes, or any return shipping costs you may incur in the refund process.

If you don't agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.

24. ARBITRATION
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION ("ARBITRATION AGREEMENT") CAREFULLY. IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE MOST DISPUTES WITH CONTEXTLOGIC AND MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.
YOU AND CONTEXTLOGIC AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY, OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE MARKETPLACE APPS, ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES SOLD OR DISTRIBUTED BY OR THROUGH THE MARKETPLACE APPS, THESE TERMS, OR CONTENT (A "DISPUTE" AS DEFINED BELOW) SHALL BE RESOLVED ONLY BY: (A) FINAL AND BINDING, BILATERAL ARBITRATION, subject to the exceptions below; OR (B) IN A SMALL CLAIMS COURT.
You and ContextLogic agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq., and federal arbitration law apply to this Arbitration Agreement and govern all questions as to whether a dispute is subject to arbitration.
24.1 Disputes
"Disputes" shall include, but are not limited to, any claims or controversies between you and ContextLogic against each other related in any way to or arising out of in any way from the Service, the Content, User Submission (Public, Personal, and/or Limited Audience), including but not limited to sales, returns, refunds, cancellations, defects, policies, privacy, advertising, or any communications between you and ContextLogic, even if the claim arises after you or ContextLogic has terminated use of Services or a user account or these Terms. Disputes also include, but are not limited to, claims that: (a) you bring against our employees, agents, affiliates, or other representatives; (b) ContextLogic brings against you; (c) in any way relate to or arise out of any aspect of the relationship between you and ContextLogic, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, advertising claims, or any other legal theory; (d) arose before you assented to these Terms or out of a prior set of Terms with ContextLogic; (e) are subject to ongoing litigation where you are not a party or a class member; and/or (f) arise after the termination of these Terms. Disputes does not include disagreements or claims concerning patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property, which shall not be subject to arbitration or the notice and good faith negotiation requirement described below.
24.2 Binding Arbitration Process and Procedure
24.2.1 Except as provided herein, if we cannot resolve a Dispute informally, any Dispute will be resolved only by inding, bilateral arbitration before one or more neutral arbitrators in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. You understand that by this Arbitration Agreement, you are giving up the right to a jury trial. You may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you in a court.
24.2.2 Unless you and ContextLogic agree otherwise, if the JAMS Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards apply (the “Consumer Minimum Standards”), the arbitration shall be administered by JAMS and a hearing shall be held near or in the county in which you reside. For residents outside the United States and/or where the Consumer Minimum Standards do not apply, arbitration shall be initiated in San Francisco, California. ContextLogic and you further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court in San Francisco County, California to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
24.2.3 If either of us intends to seek arbitration, the party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the Dispute in writing at least 30 days in advance of initiating the arbitration. Notice to ContextLogic should be sent to ContextLogic ℅ Corporation Service Company (“CSC”), 2710 Gateway Oaks Drive, Suite 150N, Sacramento, CA 95833-3505. You may send a courtesy copy to ContextLogic, Attn: Legal Dept., One Sansome Street, 40th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94104 (but this copy is only in addition to rather than instead of the letter to CSC). The notice must describe the nature of the claim and the relief being sought. If we are unable to resolve our dispute within 30 days, either party may then proceed to file a claim for arbitration.
24.2.4 If your or ContextLogic’s claim is solely for monetary relief of US $10,000 or less and does not include a request for any type of equitable remedy, the party bringing the claim may choose whether the arbitration of the claim will be conducted through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the JAMS Rules, solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator.
24.2.5 Unless you and ContextLogic agree otherwise:
Disputes involving claims and counterclaims where the combined monetary demand and value of the relief sought is less than US $500,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be decided by a single arbitrator, subject to JAMS’ most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures;
Disputes involving claims and counterclaims where the combined monetary demand and value of the relief sought is greater than US $500,000, shall be decided by a panel of three arbitrators and subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures;
The JAMS Optional Arbitration Appeal Procedures shall apply to disputes and claims having a value of US $500,000 or greater; and
The Consumer Minimum Standards shall also apply to the extent required by JAMS.
Any disagreements regarding which of the JAMS Rules apply shall be resolved by an arbitrator.
JAMS’s rules are available at http://www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267.
24.2.6 The cost of arbitration shall be borne by the parties in accordance with the applicable JAMS Rules. To the extent permitted by law, an arbitrator may award costs and/or fees if the arbitrator finds the party’s claims, defenses, or other fee-generating activity to be frivolous or asserted or conducted for an improper purpose. You are responsible for all other additional costs that you may incur in the arbitration including, without limitation, attorney’s fees and expert witness costs unless ContextLogic is specifically required to pay such fees under the JAMS Rules or applicable law.
24.2.7 If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If there is a conflict between the JAMS Rules (or the rules of the alternative arbitral forum selected by the parties) and the rules set forth in this Agreement, the rules set forth in this Agreement will govern.
24.2.8 You or ContextLogic may choose to pursue a claim in small claims court where: (a) jurisdiction and venue over you and ContextLogic otherwise qualifies for such small claims court; (b) such claim advances only on an individual (e.g. non-class, non-representative) basis; and (c) where the claim does not include a request for any type of equitable relief. However, if you decide to pursue a claim in small claims court, you agree to provide ContextLogic with advance notice by email to LER@contextlogic.com and by mail to ContextLogic, One Sansome Street, 40th Fl, Attn: Legal Dept., San Francisco, CA 94104.
24.2.9 These Terms and this Arbitration Agreement do not prevent you from bringing your Dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agency. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against ContextLogic on your behalf.
24.3 WAIVER OF CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED ACTIONS.
24.3.1 ContextLogic and you agree to resolve any dispute in an individual capacity, and not on behalf of, or as part of, any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding. ContextLogic and you further agree to not participate in any consolidated, class, or representative proceeding (existing or future) brought by any third party arising out of or relating to any dispute with a third party.
24.3.2 The arbitrator(s) cannot combine more than one person’s or entity’s claims into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class or representative proceeding (unless we agree otherwise).
24.3.3 This Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions section will also apply to any claims asserted by you against any present or future parent, subsidiary or affiliated company of ContextLogic, or any employee, officer, director, or investor of ContextLogic, and to any claims asserted by any of them against you, to the extent that any such claims is a dispute.
24.3.4 This Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions Section shall survive any termination of your account or the Services.
24.4 Authority of Arbitrator
The arbitrator(s), and not any federal, state or local court or agency shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator(s) will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and ContextLogic. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other proceedings or parties. The arbitrator(s) shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator(s) shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum's rules, and these Terms (including this Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator(s) shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which any award (or decision not to render an award) is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator(s) shall follow the applicable law. The arbitrator(s) has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator(s) is final and binding upon you and us, subject to the JAMS Optional Arbitration Appeal Procedures if applicable.
24.5 Waiver of Jury Trial
YOU AND CONTEXTLOGIC HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES IN COURT (OTHER THAN SMALL CLAIMS COURT AS PERMITTED HEREIN) AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and ContextLogic are instead electing that all covered claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in above. An arbitrator can award on your individual claims the same damages and relief as a court and must follow these Terms as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.
24.6 30-Day Right to Opt Out
You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending a timely written notice of your decision to opt out. Your notice must be sent via email to LER@contextlogic.com and to: ContextLogic, Attn: Legal Department, RE: Opt-out Notice, One Sansome Street, 40th Fl, San Francisco, CA 94104, within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your Marketplace App User ID (if any), the email address you used to set up your Marketplace App account (if you have one), your signature, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. You can find your User ID in settings. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have with us, or may enter into in the future with us.
24.7 Parents, Subsidiaries, Affiliates
This Arbitration Agreement will also apply to any claims asserted by you against any present or future parent, subsidiary, or affiliated company of ContextLogic, or any employee, officer, director, or investor of ContextLogic, and to any claims asserted by any of them against you, to the extent that any such claims arise out of or relate to these Terms (such as with respect to their validity or enforceability), the Services, any person's access to and/or use of the Services, and/or the provision of content, products, services, and/or technology on or through the Services.
24.8 Changes to This Section
24.8.1 ContextLogic will provide thirty(30) day' notice of any changes to this section by posting on the marketplace websites or apps, sending you a message, or otherwise notifying you when you are logged into your account. Amendments will become effective thirty(30) day after they are posted on the applicable website or sent to you.
24.8.2 Changes to this section will otherwise apply prospectively only to claims arising after the thirtieth (30th) day. If a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on "Changes to This Section" is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from the sections entitled "Arbitration" and "Class Waiver" and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Arbitration and Class Action Waiver sections in existence after you began using the Services.
24.9 Severability
If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. If, however, any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in section 24.3 is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth in this section 24 shall be deemed null and void in its entirety.
24.10 Survival of Agreement
This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination or expiration of these Terms or your relationship with ContextLogic.
