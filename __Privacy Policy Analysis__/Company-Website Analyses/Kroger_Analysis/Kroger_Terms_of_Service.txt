9. KROGER PAY
Kroger Pay is a digital wallet offered by Kroger within the App. The Kroger Pay wallet allows you to store tokenized payment card information for permitted payment cards and initiate transactions from such cards using your mobile phone at participating locations in the Kroger Family of Companies. By loading your payment card information within the App, you have requested that such payment card(s) be made available through the Kroger Pay functionality to initiate transactions as described herein. Neither the Kroger Pay wallet nor the App stores untokenized card information.
You must have established a digital account and have downloaded the App to your mobile phone to participate in Kroger Pay. You may load to your Kroger Pay wallet with your Kroger Rewards Debit Card and any credit card, debit card or prepaid card that participates in one of the payment networks we identify from time to time by providing the card number and any other information requested. You may load your payment card information to your digital account through the Site or the App. All payment card information that you add to or update in your digital account via the Site or your Kroger Pay wallet will automatically be updated within both your digital account accessible through the Site and the Kroger Pay wallet. You may not load a non-reloadable gift card bearing one of the brands of the Kroger Family of Companies to your Kroger Pay Wallet at this time.
If you add more than one payment card to your Kroger Pay wallet, you may select a default payment mechanism that will be used for each transaction initiated using Kroger Pay unless you select an alternative payment mechanism when prompted. You are responsible for properly entering your payment card information and for keeping such information up to date. You may remove any payment card from Kroger Pay at any time using either the Site or the App. If any payment card you have loaded to Kroger Pay is closed, suspended or otherwise not active or valid, you will not be able to use that card to make purchases through Kroger Pay. If a transaction you initiate with a payment card in your Kroger Pay wallet is declined, you may initiate payment using another payment card you have added to your Kroger Pay wallet or you may make payment with another accepted payment method.
By loading any payment card into Kroger Pay, you authorize Kroger to charge that payment card when you use Kroger Pay to make any purchase. Each time you use Kroger Pay for a transaction, you acknowledge and agree that you are authorizing Kroger to charge the relevant payment card(s) you have added to Kroger Pay.
You will need to use a security feature, such as fingerprint, facial recognition or a PIN to initiate a transaction with Kroger Pay. You are responsible for maintaining the security and confidentiality of your Kroger Pay wallet and are responsible for all transactions initiated using your Kroger Pay wallet. You should not share your security credentials with any third party, but if you do, you will be deemed to have authorized them to use Kroger Pay on your behalf and to charge your payment cards. If you believe the confidentiality of your security credentials has been compromised, please change them immediately. If you lose your mobile device, to prevent unauthorized transactions from your Kroger Pay wallet, you should immediately delete the payment card information stored in your Kroger Pay wallet and your Kroger digital account. You may set up a new digital account and Kroger Pay wallet.
Kroger Pay is accepted at participating in-store locations in the Kroger Family of Companies in the United States, which can be viewed at the Kroger Pay FAQ page and which list may be updated by Kroger from time to time. Kroger Pay is not accepted at Kroger Fuel Centers, certain independent merchants within Kroger Stores or online and cannot be used at stores outside of the Kroger Family of Companies. Kroger may limit items that may be purchased using Kroger Pay or may impose conditions, such as identity verification, on purchases made using Kroger Pay.
To pay for a purchase using Kroger Pay, you must open the Kroger Pay functionality with the App on your mobile phone and authenticate your identity when prompted via PIN, fingerprint or facial recognition. Once you are authenticated, Kroger Pay will generate and deliver a transaction-specific QR (Quick Response) Code to your mobile phone that you must scan at the POS (manned or self-checkout) to initiate payment at checkout. The QR Code includes your Kroger Co. Family of Stores Rewards program information as well as your tokenized payment card information. If the transaction is approved, a printed receipt will be available at checkout. The Kroger Pay wallet supports split tender transactions to the extent otherwise permitted at the point of sale at the Kroger Family of Companies.
Eligible purchases made through Kroger Pay will earn loyalty points in accordance with the applicable Kroger Co. Family of Stores Rewards programs offered by Kroger. From time to time, Kroger may offer special promotions or discounts for using Kroger Pay to make purchases. Any such promotions or discounts will be subject to the terms and conditions provided or made available in connection with such special promotion or discount. Additionally, if you make a Kroger Pay purchase using your Rewards Debit Card, a credit card that bears the mark of one of the Kroger Family of Companies or payment network branded prepaid card that bears the mark of one of the Kroger Family of Companies, you may be eligible for enhanced loyalty benefits offered by Kroger from time to time. Rewards points earned using Kroger Pay will automatically be credited to your Kroger Co. Family of Store Rewards loyalty account in accordance with the terms of the applicable Kroger Co. Family of Stores Rewards program or Kroger Pay promotion. It may take up to forty-eight (48) hours for rewards to be credited to your loyalty account. When you make a purchase for which coupons and/or accrued loyalty benefits loaded to your digital account are eligible, such coupons and/or loyalty benefits may be automatically redeemed when you use your Kroger Pay wallet to make the purchase. Redemption of such benefits will be reflected on a receipt or in your digital account.
We will not assess any fees or charges for your use of Kroger Pay. However, your mobile carrier may assess message or data fees or charges and you are responsible for such fees and charges.
You acknowledge that the terms of your agreements with the issuers of your payment cards, including any applicable transaction limits and fees, govern their use through Kroger Pay. The Kroger Pay terms and conditions do not modify your agreements with your card issuers. If you have a question or dispute regarding a transaction using Kroger Pay, you should contact us at 1-866-544-8062. If you have a question or dispute regarding your payment cards, you should contact your card issuer.
We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your use of Kroger Pay at any time without notice.
