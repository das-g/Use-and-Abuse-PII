MANDATORY AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS (“ARBITRATION AGREEMENT”)
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS. IT CONTAINS PROCEDURES FOR FINAL BINDING ARBITRATION AND A WAIVER OF ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO PROCEED IN A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION (hereinafter “Class Action”).

Most customer concerns can be resolved by calling Customer Service at 855-564-5105. In the event Customer Service is unable to resolve a complaint to your satisfaction, this section explains how any Claims (as defined below) are resolved through arbitration.

In this Arbitration Agreement, the term “Kohl’s” includes Kohl’s Inc., its parent Kohl’s Corporation, as well as any of their respective affiliates or subsidiaries, and any persons or entities (including agents or employees) related to Kohl’s or its affiliates or subsidiaries.

YOU AND KOHL’S AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY, OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF USE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY PURCHASES, RETURNS OR OTHER TRANSACTIONS THAT YOU ENGAGE IN WITH KOHL’S IN-STORE, ONLINE, OR THROUGH THE MOBILE APPLICATION (SUBJECT TO THE LIMITED EXCEPTIONS SET FORTH BELOW), SHALL BE RESOLVED ONLY BY: (a) FINAL AND BINDING, BILATERAL ARBITRATION, subject to the exceptions below; or (b) IN A SMALL CLAIMS COURT.

You and Kohl’s agree that these Terms of Use affect interstate commerce and the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq., and federal arbitration law apply to this Arbitration Agreement and govern all questions as to whether a dispute is subject to arbitration.

ARBITRATION REPLACES THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT. YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL, OR FILE OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. IN ARBITRATION, DISPUTES ARE RESOLVED BY AN ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY.

This Arbitration Agreement Applies to all “Disputes.” For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Disputes” shall include, but are not limited to, any claims or controversies between you and Kohl’s that are related in any way to these Terms of Use, including but not limited to your use of this website, sales, returns, refunds, cancellations, defects, policies, privacy, advertising, and/or any communications between you and Kohl’s, whether occurring on this website, in the mobile application, or in-store, even if the Dispute arises after the termination of your relationship with Kohl’s. Disputes also include, but are not limited to, claims that: (a) you bring against our employees, agents, affiliates, or other representatives; (b) Kohl’s brings against you; (c) in any way relate to or arise out of any aspect of the relationship between you and Kohl’s, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, advertising claims, or any other legal theory; (d) arose before these Terms of Use or out of a prior agreement with Kohl’s; (e) are subject to ongoing litigation where you are not a party or a class member; and/or (f) arise after the termination of these Terms of Use. Disputes, however, do not include disagreements or claims concerning patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property, which shall not be subject to arbitration or the notice and good faith negotiation requirement described below. All Disputes are subject to this Arbitration Agreement, no matter what legal theory on which they are based and irrespective of the remedy sought, including any type of injunctive, declaratory, or other equitable relief. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. These Terms of Use and this Arbitration Agreement do not prevent you from bringing your Dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agency.
Arbitration Rules; Procedures; Fees. If either of us intends to seek arbitration, the party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the Dispute in writing at least 30 days in advance of initiating the arbitration. Notice to Kohl’s should be sent to Kohl’s, Legal Department, N56 W17000 Ridgewood Drive, Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin 53051. The notice must describe the nature of the claim and the relief being sought. If we are unable to resolve our dispute within 30 days, either party may then proceed to initiate an arbitration.
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Kohl’s Registered Agent/Legal Department, located at: Kohl’s Legal Department, N56 W17000 Ridgewood Drive, Menomonee Falls, WI 53051 or we must send a written notice to you at the most current address we have on file for you. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules as applicable. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. Kohl’s will reimburse all such filing, administration and arbitrator fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, Kohl’s will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
Waiver of Class Action or Consolidated Claims. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Kohl’s is entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (h) below.
Small Claims Court. Either you or Kohl’s may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in Waukesha County, Wisconsin, or any United States county where you live or work.
Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND Kohl’s WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY. You and Kohl’s are instead choosing to have all Disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Kohl’s over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND Kohl’s WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.
Opt-out. You have the right to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: Kohl’s, Legal Department, N56 W17000 Ridgewood Drive, Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin 53051, postmarked within sixty (60) days of first accepting these Terms of Use. You must include (i) your name and residence address, (ii) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account, and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Terms of Use Arbitration Agreement.
Exclusive Venue. If you send the opt-out notice in (g), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or Kohl’s to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms of Use in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party, and both you and Kohl’s agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, Waukesha County, Wisconsin, or the federal district in which that county falls. In any such court proceeding, YOU AND Kohl’s WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL.
Severability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. If, however, any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth above is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then this Arbitration Agreement shall be deemed null and void in its entirety. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Kohl’s.

PRICING & PRODUCT INFORMATION
While Kohl’s strives to provide accurate product and pricing information, unintentional pricing or typographical errors may occur. Kohl’s reserves the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions and to change or update information (including, without limitation, information related to text, pricing, availability and product descriptions) at any time without notice (including after you submitted your order and confirmation was received). In the event that an item is listed at an incorrect price, with incorrect information, or discounted in error, Kohl’s shall have the right, in its sole discretion and to the fullest extent permissible by applicable law, to refuse or cancel any purchased orders placed for that item. If your credit card has been charged for any order subsequently cancelled, Kohl’s will issue a credit to your credit card as your sole and exclusive remedy if permissible under applicable law. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you.

Kohl’s works hard to provide low prices on this Site as well as in Stores. However, merchandise and promotional offers available online at Kohls.com may vary from those offered in Store. Prices and availability are subject to change without notice. “Sale” prices and percentage savings offered by Kohl’s are discounts from Kohl’s “Regular” or “Original” prices. The “Regular” or “Original” price of an item is the former or future offered price for the item or a comparable item by Kohl’s or another retailer. Actual sales may not have been made at the “Regular” or “Original” prices, and intermediate markdowns may have been taken. “Original” prices may not have been in effect during the past 90 days or in all trade areas. Merchandise on this Site could be offered at the same or lower “Sale” prices during future promotional events beginning on or after the last day of this advertised event. Clearance merchandise, Kohl’s Cares® Cause merchandise or other charitable items are excluded from “Entire Stock” promotions in this Site. In some events, actual savings may exceed the percent savings shown.

You agree that you are responsible for all charges incurred in connection with any purchase on our Site or our Stores, including, without limitation, all taxes, shipping, handling and processing charges or other fees.

These restrictions may be applied at Kohl’s discretion, including, without limitation, to purchases/orders placed by the same person, the same Kohls.com account, the same credit card and/or orders that use the same billing or shipping address.
