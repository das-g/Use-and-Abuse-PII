Yahoo Terms of Service
 
ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS
Welcome to Yahoo. Yahoo! Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd. (Co. Reg. No. 199700735D) ("we" and "us", as the case may be) provides the Service (as defined below) to you, subject to the following Terms of Service ("TOS"). These TOS are applicable even if you do not have an account with Yahoo, and your use of Yahoo services means that you consent to these TOS. We may update or modify the TOS in our sole discretion from time to time without notice to you, including by publishing changes on or via the Service, and you agree that your continued use of the Service after such update or modification will constitute your acceptance of and agreement to be bound by the updated or modified TOS. You are responsible for ensuring that you fully understand the most current version of the TOS at all times, and you may access the current version at any time at: https://policies.yahoo.com/sg/en/yahoo/terms/utos/index.htm. In addition, when using particular Yahoo owned or operated services, you and Yahoo shall be subject to any posted guidelines or rules applicable to such services, which may be posted from time to time. All such guidelines or rules (including but not limited to our Privacy Policy and Intellectual Property Rights Policy, as they may be updated from time to time by postings on this website) are hereby incorporated by reference into the TOS. In most cases the guidelines and rules are specific to a particular part of the Service and will assist you in applying the TOS to that part, but to the extent of any inconsistency between the TOS and any guideline or rule, the TOS will prevail. Yahoo and/or its holding, parent, subsidiary or related companies may also offer other services that are governed by different Terms of Service , in which case the TOS do not apply to such other services if and to the extent expressly excluded by such different Terms of Services.
DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE
Yahoo provides users with access to a rich collection of resources, including various communications tools, forums, shopping services, search services, personalized content and branded programming (the "Service") through its network of properties which may be accessed through any various medium or device now known or hereafter developed , including but not limited to the World Wide Web, mobile telephone or communications services (such as SMS (Short Message Service)), and/or other Internet or telecommunications services or protocols (such as WAP (Wireless Application Protocol)). You also understand and agree that the Service may include advertisements and that these advertisements are necessary for Yahoo to provide the Service. You also understand and agree that the Service may include certain communications from Yahoo, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the Yahoo Newsletter, and that these communications are considered an integral part of Yahoo membership and you will not be able to opt out of receiving them unless you terminate your account. Accordingly, you are deemed to have irrevocably consented to receiving such communications on an ongoing basis so long as you maintain your account. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new Yahoo properties, shall be subject to the TOS. You understand and agree that the Service is provided "AS-IS" and that Yahoo assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery or failure to store any user communications or personalization settings. You are responsible for obtaining access to the Service, and that access may involve third-party fees (such as Internet service provider or airtime charges). You are responsible for those fees, including those fees associated with the display or delivery of advertisements. In addition, you must provide and are responsible for all equipment necessary to access the Service.

Unless expressly stated otherwise, no information presented in the Service or in connection with any products and services forming part of the Service shall be deemed as a binding offer by us or the relevant third party, but may constitute an invitation for you to place an order. In respect of contracts for our or any third party's products and services which are made available as part of the Service, these shall be deemed concluded when we or the relevant third party have accepted your order for the same or have provided you with the product or service pursuant to your order.

Please be aware that Yahoo has created certain areas on the Service that are restricted from general viewing and you must fulfill the specified conditions to access and view such areas.
YOUR REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS
In consideration of your use of the Service, you represent that you either: (i) are of legal age to form a binding contract and are not a person barred from receiving the Services under the laws applicable to your location or other applicable jurisdiction, or (ii) have obtained the prior consent of your parent or legal guardian to use the Service subject to and in accordance with the TOS.

You also agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service's registration form (the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Yahoo has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Yahoo has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service (or any portion thereof). Yahoo is concerned about the safety and privacy of all its users, particularly children. However, please remember that the Service is designed to appeal to a broad audience. Accordingly, if you are a parent or legal guardian, it is your responsibility to determine whether any of the Services and/or Content (as defined in Section 6 below) are appropriate for your child. Similarly, if you are a child, you are required to obtain the consent of your parent or legal guardian before using or accessing any of the Services and/or Content.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may provide you with access to some parts of the Service without you registering as a user. In that case, your identification is based on other means of identification that we deem appropriate. In appropriate cases, identification may be based on data identifying your mobile telephone or communications subscription, such as your subscription number or MSISDN (Mobile Service Integrated Services Digital Network) number provided by your network operator. You agree that such information may be collected and disclosed to us and used in accordance with the TOS, including our Privacy Policy described below.
YAHOO! PRIVACY POLICY
Registration Data and certain other information about you is subject to our Privacy Policy which is incorporated by reference into and made a part of this TOS. By giving or making available the Registration Data and such other information about yourself to us, you agree and acknowledge that we may use or release such information to third parties as specified in the Privacy Policy, and that you give consent to such use or disclosure. You further agree that providing us with your Registration Data and/or using the Service, you expressly request to receive and consent to receiving communications and materials from Yahoo from time to time. For more information, see our full privacy policy at https://policies.yahoo.com/sg/en/yahoo/privacy/index.html. You understand that through your use of the Service you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the Privacy Policy) of this information, including the transfer of this information to the United States and/or other countries for storage, processing and use by Yahoo and its affiliates.
MEMBER ACCOUNT, PASSWORD AND SECURITY
You will receive a password and account designation upon completing the Service's registration process. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and account and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account. You agree to (a) immediately notify Yahoo of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. Yahoo cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this Section 5.
MEMBER CONDUCT

You acknowledge that Yahoo may or may not pre-screen or filter Content, but that Yahoo and its designees shall have the right (but not the obligation) in their sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse, move or remove any Content that is transmitted or made available via the Service. Without limiting the foregoing, Yahoo and its designees shall have the right to remove any Content (whether or not provided by you) that we believe in good faith may be unlawful or violates the TOS or that has been alleged to infringe any intellectual property or that is otherwise objectionable in our sole opinion, without being liable to you in any way for any loss or damage arising from such removal. You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Content, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such Content. In this regard, you acknowledge that you may not rely on any Content created by Yahoo or submitted to Yahoo, including without limitation information in Yahoo Groups or Yahoo Answers and in all other parts of the Service.

You acknowledge, consent and agree that Yahoo may in its sole discretion access, preserve and disclose your account information and Content if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process and law enforcement or other government requests; (b) enforce the TOS or evidence our rights or defend ourselves; (c) respond to claims that any Content is unlawful or violates the rights of third parties; (d) respond to your requests for customer service; or (e) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Yahoo, its users and the public.

You understand that the Service and software embodied within the Service may include security components that permit digital materials to be protected, and that use of these materials is subject to usage rules set by Yahoo and/or content providers who provide content to the Service. You may not attempt to override or circumvent any of the usage rules embedded into the Service. Any unauthorized reproduction, publication, further distribution or public exhibition of the materials provided on the Service, in whole or in part, is strictly prohibited.
NATURE OF COMMUNICATIONS ON YAHOO! NETWORK
When you register with Yahoo, you acknowledge that in using the Services to send electronic communications (including but not limited to email, search queries, sending messages to Yahoo Groups, uploading photos and files to Flickr, and other Internet activities), you will be causing communications to be sent through Yahoo's computer networks, different portions of which are located in different jurisdictions. As a result, and also as a result of Yahoo's network architecture and business practices and the nature of electronic communications, even communications that seem to be intrastate or domestic in nature can result in the transmission of interstate or cross-border communications regardless of where you are physically located at the time of transmission. Accordingly, by agreeing to this Terms of Service, you acknowledge that use of the service results in interstate and cross-border data transmissions.

Yahoo Messenger, including any web-based versions, will allow you and the people with whom you communicate to save your conversations in your Yahoo accounts located on Yahoo servers. This means you can access and search your message history from any computer with access to the internet. Whether or not you use this feature, other users may choose to use it to save conversations with you in their account on Yahoo too. Your agreement to this TOS constitutes your consent to allow Yahoo to store these communications on its servers. From time to time Yahoo may send you notices through the Yahoo Messenger Service to let you know about important changes to the Yahoo Messenger or related Services. Such messages may not be received if you violate this TOS by accessing the Service in an unauthorized manner. Your agreement to this TOS constitutes your agreement that you are deemed to have received any and all notices that would have been delivered had you accessed the Service in an authorized manner.
SPECIAL ADMONITIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL USE AND EXPORT AND IMPORT COMPLIANCE
Recognizing the global nature of the Internet, you agree to comply with all local rules regarding online conduct and acceptable Content. Use of the Yahoo Services and transfer, posting and uploading of software, technology, and other technical data via the Yahoo Services may be subject to the export and import laws of the United States, Singapore and other countries. You agree to comply with all applicable export and import laws and regulations, including without limitation the Export Administration Regulations (see http://www.access.gpo.gov/bis/ear/ear_data.html) and sanctions control programs of the United States (see http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Pages/Programs.aspx). In particular, you represent and warrant that you:


are not a prohibited party identified on any government export exclusion lists (see http://www.bis.doc.gov/complianceandenforcement/liststocheck.htm) or a member of a government of any other export-prohibited countries as identified in applicable export and import laws and regulations;
will not transfer software, technology, and other technical data via the Yahoo Services to export-prohibited parties or countries;
will not use the Yahoo Services for military, nuclear, missile, chemical or biological weaponry end uses in violation of U.S. and/or Singapore export laws; and
will not transfer, upload, or post via the Yahoo Services any software, technology or other technical data in violation of U.S., Singapore or other applicable export or import laws.
CONTENT SUBMITTED OR MADE AVAILABLE FOR INCLUSION ON THE SERVICE
Yahoo does not claim ownership of Content you submit or make available for inclusion on the Service. However, with respect to Content you submit or make available for inclusion on publicly accessible areas of the Service, you grant Yahoo the following worldwide, royalty-free, transferable and non-exclusive license(s), as applicable:


With respect to Content you submit or make available for inclusion on publicly accessible areas of Yahoo Groups, the license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, broadcast, publicly perform and publicly display such Content on the Service solely for the purposes of providing and promoting the specific Yahoo Group to which such Content was submitted or made available. This license exists only for as long as you elect to continue to include such Content on the Service and will terminate at the time you remove or Yahoo removes such Content from the Service.
With respect to photos, graphics, audio or video you submit or make available for inclusion on publicly accessible areas of the Service other than Yahoo Groups, the license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, publish, broadcast, adapt, publicly perform and publicly display such Content on the Service solely for the purpose for which such Content was submitted or made available. This license exists only for as long as you elect to continue to include such Content on the Service and will terminate at the time you remove or Yahoo removes such Content from the Service.
With respect to Content other than photos, graphics, audio or video you submit or make available for inclusion on publicly accessible areas of the Service other than Yahoo Groups, the perpetual, irrevocable and fully sublicensable license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, broadcast, translate, publicly perform and publicly display such Content (in whole or in part) and to incorporate such Content into other works in any format or medium now known or later developed.
"Publicly accessible" areas of the Service are those areas of the Yahoo network of properties that are intended by Yahoo to be available to the general public. By way of example, publicly accessible areas of the Service would include Yahoo Answers and portions of Yahoo Groups that are open to both members and visitors. However, publicly accessible areas of the Service would not include portions of Yahoo Groups that are limited to members, Yahoo services intended for private communication such as Yahoo Mail or Yahoo Messenger, or areas off of the Yahoo network of properties such as portions of World Wide Web sites that are accessible via hypertext or other links but are not hosted or served by Yahoo.
You acknowledge that by transmitting or making available Content through the Service, you are assuming the risk that others may reproduce or otherwise make use of the Content. You agree not to hold Yahoo liable for any third-party reproduction or use made of such Content, whether or not you have consented to such reproduction or use.
CONTRIBUTIONS TO YAHOO!
By submitting ideas, suggestions, documents, and/or proposals ("Contributions") to Yahoo through its suggestion or feedback webpages, you acknowledge and agree that: (a) your Contributions do not contain confidential or proprietary information; (b) Yahoo is not under any obligation of confidentiality, express or implied, with respect to the Contributions; (c) Yahoo shall be entitled to use or disclose (or choose not to use or disclose) such Contributions for any purpose, in any way, in any media worldwide; (d) Yahoo may have something similar to the Contributions already under consideration or in development; (e) your Contributions automatically become the property of Yahoo without any obligation of Yahoo to you; and (f) you are not entitled to any compensation or reimbursement of any kind from Yahoo under any circumstances.
INDEMNITY
You agree to indemnify and hold Yahoo and its parent, holding, subsidiary, affiliated and related companies, officers, agents, employees, partners, suppliers, vendors, co-branders, licensors harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of Content you submit, post, transmit or otherwise make available through the Service, your use of the Service, your connection to the Service, your violation of the TOS, or your violation of any rights of another or your breach of any applicable law.
NO RESALE OF SERVICE
You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, trade, resell or exploit for any commercial purposes, any portion of the Service (including your Yahoo ID), use of the Service, or access to the Service.
GENERAL PRACTICES REGARDING USE AND STORAGE
You acknowledge that Yahoo may, in its sole discretion, establish general practices and limits concerning use of the Service, including without limitation the manner in which the Service is used, the maximum number of days that email messages, message board postings or other uploaded Content will be retained by the Service, the maximum number of email messages that may be sent from or received by an account on the Service, the maximum size of any email message that may be sent from or received by an account on the Service, the maximum disk space that will be allotted on Yahoo's servers on your behalf, and the maximum number of times (and the maximum duration for which) you may access the Service in a given period of time.

TERMINATION
You agree that Yahoo may, under certain circumstances and without prior notice, immediately terminate the agreement formed by this TOS and terminate your Yahoo account, any associated email address, and access to the whole or any part of the Service. Cause for such termination shall include, but not be limited to, (a) breaches or violations or purported breaches or violations of the TOS or other incorporated agreements or guidelines or of applicable law, (b) requests by law enforcement or other government agencies, (c) a request by you (self-initiated account deletions), (d) discontinuance or material modification to the Service (or any part thereof), (e) unexpected technical or security issues or problems, (f) extended periods of inactivity, (g) our good faith belief that you are using or intend to use the Service to engage in fraudulent or illegal activities, and/or (h) nonpayment of any fees owed by you in connection with the Services.

The Service may also include access to products and services of independent third parties either directly or via links to sites operated by such third party advertisers. Your correspondence or business dealings with, or participation in promotions of, advertisers found on or through the Service, including payment and delivery of related goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such advertisers, even where it is in relation to any products or services that are co-branded with us which may include our trademarks . You agree that Yahoo shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings or as the result of the presence of such advertisers on the Service.

The Service may provide, or third parties may provide, links to other World Wide Web sites or resources. Because Yahoo has no control over such sites and resources, you acknowledge and agree that Yahoo is not responsible for the availability of such external sites or resources, and does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any Content, advertising, products or other materials on or available from such sites or resources. You further acknowledge and agree that Yahoo shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such Content, goods or services available on or through any such site or resource.

For the avoidance of doubt, except to the extent provided in Section 23, you and us are the only parties to the TOS.

Choice of Law and Forum. The TOS and the relationship between you and Yahoo shall be governed by the laws of Singapore without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and Yahoo agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Singapore.

Waiver and Severability of Terms. The failure of Yahoo to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the TOS is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and to construe such provision to the maximum extent permitted by law so as to render that provision valid and enforceable, and the other provisions of the TOS remain in full force and effect.
