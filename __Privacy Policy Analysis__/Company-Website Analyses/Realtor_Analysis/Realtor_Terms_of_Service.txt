Move does not take applications for loans or credit nor issue or participate in the issuance of pre-qualifications or pre-approvals.
Any request for, inquiry about or agreement to receive or be contacted about loans, loan applications, quotes, pre-qualifications, pre-approvals, loan commitments or loan-related transactions by any consumer or person (e.g., by way of advertisements on Web sites or mobile apps operated by Move) is not, and will not be responded to by Move as, an order, application, offer or transaction for any credit, loan, loan application, quote, pre-qualification, pre-approval, loan commitment or loan-related transaction or other loan or credit product.
Move does not endorse or recommend any lender, any borrower nor any of the products, rates or offerings of any lender, broker or mortgage professional.
Nothing contained in any mortgage-related ad or other ad is an offer to provide, or a solicitation for, any loan, loan application, quote, pre-qualification, pre-approval, loan commitment or loan-related transaction.

Ability to Opt Out from Receiving Certain Communications.
You have the choice to opt out of receiving certain marketing communications (email or text messages) you might receive from Move or a Move division (each referred to here as a "Sender"). Normally, a marketing email you receive from a Sender will have an opt-out link provided within the email itself (usually toward the bottom), and you typically can opt out of receiving further such marketing emails by clicking on the opt-out link and indicating your decision. If you receive marketing texts from a Sender, you typically can opt out of receiving further such texts by following instructions provided in the text itself, often by texting "STOP" to 22445, or by emailing the Move Customer Care team at Privacy@Move.com and including sufficient information to allow the Sender to properly respond to your request (e.g., your full name, your complete phone number with area code, and an image or description of the marketing text you received). Whether it's email or text, your request will be handled promptly; but please note that for a reasonable time you might receive further such marketing emails or texts while the Sender processes your request. Note also that opting out of marketing emails or texts will not necessarily cause you to stop receiving non-marketing emails or texts, such as texts about a purchase you may have made, a transaction you may have with a Sender, a lead you have submitted about a property that is for sale or perhaps even about listing alerts you may have requested, as well as other types (for example, about technical, administrative or informational matters) -- but even some or all of these kinds of messages (especially if texts) the Sender may stop as well.
Some additional program details regarding SMS (text) messaging from a Sender, including about opt out, are as follows:
Message and data rates may apply.
Message number and frequency varies and may be recurring for any given program.
Text "STOP" to 22445 in reply to a marketing text from a Sender to stop receiving further such texts (see above for other details).
Text "HELP" to 22445 in reply to a marketing text from a Sender to seek help or assistance.
Example of a program's sponsor or Sender: realtor.com
Texts sent may include both marketing and non-marketing texts.
Carriers disclaim liability for delayed or undelivered messages.

General Terms
Applicable Law; Agreement to Arbitrate
These Terms of Use are governed by the laws of the State of California, U.S.A. without regard to conflicts of laws principles. YOU HEREBY AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL DISPUTES OR CLAIMS THAT MAY ARISE BETWEEN YOU AND MOVE SHALL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT, EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY ASSERT CLAIMS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT IF YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY. THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT SHALL GOVERN THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS PARAGRAPH. YOU AGREE THAT YOU AND MOVE MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS PART OF ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND MOVE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. FURTHER, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). THE ARBITRATION WILL BE CONDUCTED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION ("AAA") UNDER ITS RULES AND PROCEDURES, AS MODIFIED BY THIS PARAGRAPH. THE AAA'S RULES ARE AVAILABLE AT WWW.ADR.ORG. A FORM FOR INITIATING ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS IS AVAILABLE ON THE AAA'S WEB SITE AT https://www.adr.org/. THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE HELD IN THE COUNTY IN WHICH YOU RESIDE OR AT ANOTHER MUTUALLY AGREED LOCATION. IF THE VALUE OF THE RELIEF SOUGHT IS $10,000 OR LESS, YOU OR MOVE MAY ELECT TO HAVE THE ARBITRATION CONDUCTED BY TELEPHONE OR BASED SOLELY ON WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS, WHICH ELECTION SHALL BE BINDING ON YOU AND MOVE SUBJECT TO THE ARBITRATOR'S DISCRETION TO REQUIRE AN IN-PERSON HEARING, IF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT. ATTENDANCE AT AN IN-PERSON HEARING MAY BE MADE BY TELEPHONE BY YOU AND/OR MOVE, UNLESS THE ARBITRATOR REQUIRES OTHERWISE. THE ARBITRATOR'S AWARD SHALL BE FINAL AND BINDING AND JUDGMENT ON THE AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR MAY BE ENTERED IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION THEREOF. PAYMENT OF ALL FILING, ADMINISTRATION AND ARBITRATOR FEES WILL BE GOVERNED BY THE AAA'S RULES, UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED IN THIS PARAGRAPH. IF A COURT DECIDES THAT ANY PART OF THIS PARAGRAPH IS INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE, THE OTHER PARTS OF THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL STILL APPLY. ACCESS OR USE OF THE MOVE NETWORK IS UNAUTHORIZED IN ANY JURISDICTION THAT DOES NOT GIVE EFFECT TO ALL PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THIS PARAGRAPH.
You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Move as a result of the Terms of Use or accessing or using the Move Network. Move’s performance under the Terms of Use is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in the Terms of Use is in derogation of Move’s right to comply with governmental, court and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your access or use of the Move Network or information provided to or gathered by Move with respect to such use.

Interpretation of the Terms of Use
If any part of the Terms of Use is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations contained herein, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the Terms of Use shall continue in effect. Unless otherwise specified herein (or in any other definitive written agreement between you and Move), the Terms of Use constitutes the entire agreement between you and Move with respect to the Move Network and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between you and Move with respect to the Move Network. A printed version of the Terms of Use and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to the Terms of Use to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.
