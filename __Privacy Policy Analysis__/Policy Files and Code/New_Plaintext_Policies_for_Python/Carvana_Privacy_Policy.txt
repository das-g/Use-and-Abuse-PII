We also collect information, via cookies, web beacons, pixels, tags, or other tracking technologies (“Tracking Technologies”), such as your Internet Service Provider and IP address, the date and time you access our website(s), the pages you accessed while visiting our website(s), and the Internet address from which you accessed our website(s). We may place cookies on your device, which may last only during a single session or may be persistent over multiple sessions over time. We use these technologies to remember user preferences, maximize the performance of our website(s) and services, provide you with offers that may be of interest to you, measure the effectiveness of our email and other advertising campaigns, and to personalize online content. These Tracking Technologies may be used to track you across devices and websites over time.
Additionally, we may permit third parties to place Tracking Technologies on our website(s) to allow these third parties to directly collect personal information from you. These third parties may also use Tracking Technologies to serve you advertisements tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on this website and other sites, applications, destinations, and services you have visited, and for other lawful business purposes. In doing so, these third parties may collect your Personal Information, including for example the make, model, settings, specifications (e.g., CPU speed, connection speed, browser type, operating system, device identifier) and geographic location of your computer, mobile or other device, as well as date/time stamp, IP address, pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, the site(s), application(s), destination(s), and/or service(s) you arrived from, and other clickstream data.
To provide you with more relevant and interesting experiences, we may work with third party companies to display ads or customize the content on this website and on other digital properties and websites. For example:
o	We use Google Analytics to analyze traffic to our Web site(s) in order to help us understand our customers' and visitors' needs and to continually improve our site for them. The data they collect on our behalf may include, but is not limited to, search engine referral, affiliate referrals, traffic driven by banner ads or other online promotions, how visitors navigate around the site, and the most popular pages. We also collect certain technical information, such as the browser version and operating system. We reserve the right to use, transfer, sell, and share data about our users for any lawful business purpose, such as analyzing usage trends and seeking compatible advertisers, sponsors, clients, and customers. For more information related to our use of Google Analytics, please visit www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.
o	We use Facebook Pixel and/or related Facebook business tools that may allow third parties, including Facebook, to use cookies, web beacons, and other storage technologies to collect or receive information from our website(s), app(s), and/or elsewhere on the Internet and use that information to provide measurement services and target ads.
These companies may use cookies and similar tracking technologies as described in this Notice to gather information about your visits to our website(s), as well as your visits elsewhere on the Internet. These companies use this information to provide you with more relevant advertising known as interest-based advertising. For more information about third-party advertisers, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. This is a site offered by the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") that includes information on how consumers can opt-out from receiving interest-based advertising from some or all of NAI's members. The Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) also offers a choice mechanism with respect to certain types of data collection and use by third parties available at www.aboutads.info. Opting out of interest-based advertising will not opt you out of all advertising, but rather only interest-based advertising from us or our agents or representatives.
Some browsers have incorporated Do Not Track (“DNT”) preferences. Most of these features, when turned on, send signals to the website you are visiting that you do not wish to have information about your online searching and browsing activities collected and used. As there is not yet a common agreement about how to interpret DNT signals, we do not honor DNT signals from website browsers at this time. However, you may refuse or delete cookies. If you refuse or delete cookies, some of our website(s) functionality may be impaired. If you change computers, devices, or browsers, or use multiple computers, devices, or browsers, and delete your cookies, you may need to repeat this process for each computer, device, or browser. Please refer to your browser’s Help instructions to learn more about how to manage cookies and the use of other tracking technologies.
G. Security and Retention
We maintain reasonable security procedures and technical and organizational measures to protect your Personal Information against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, disclosure, alteration, or use. However, because no data transmission is completely secure, and no system of physical or electronic security is impenetrable, we cannot guarantee the security of the information you send to us or the security of our servers, networks or databases, and by using our Service you agree to assume all risk in connection with the information sent to us or collected by us when you access, visit and/or use our Service, including without limitation your personally identifiable information or other Registration Information, and we are not responsible for any loss of such information or the consequences thereof.
