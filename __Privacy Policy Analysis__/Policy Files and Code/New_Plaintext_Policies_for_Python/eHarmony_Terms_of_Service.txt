a. Minimum Age. You must be at least 18 years old to register for the Services. By using the Singles Service, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old.
b. Marital Status. By registering to use or using the Singles Service, you represent and warrant that you are single or (if legally married) separated. If you are married and not separated, you may not register to use or use the Singles Service.
c. Criminal History. By requesting to use, registering to use, and/or using the Singles Service, you represent and warrant that you have never been convicted of a felony (or other indictable offense) and/or are not required to register as a sex offender with any government entity. EHARMONY DOES NOT CURRENTLY CONDUCT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND SCREENINGS ON ITS MEMBERS. However, to the extent permissible by applicable law, eHarmony reserves the right to conduct any criminal background check, at any time and using available public records, to confirm your compliance with this subsection. BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU HEREBY AUTHORIZE ANY SUCH CHECK IF IT IS LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE IN YOUR JURISDICTION.
d. Meeting Matching System Criteria. The Singles Service requires your completion of the Compatibility Quiz for eharmony to find highly compatible matches for you. eharmony will not be able to provide matches to users who have not completed the Compatibility Quiz.
2. Use of the Services
As a user of any of the Services (a "Registered User"), you agree to the following:
a. Basic Membership. It is free to register for the Singles Service, which may be used by you at no cost (“Basic Membership”). Once you have registered by providing preliminary information (including email address and password), you will be asked to answer a scientifically- based Compatibility Quiz which has been structured by reference to specific psychological criteria. The results of the Compatibility Quiz as well as comprehensive statistical comparative data are used by eharmony to automatically create your individual personality profile. Your personality profile will then be integrated into the eharmony database. Once in our database, your personality profile is (through an automated process) matched up to the profiles of other eharmony members, which enables eharmony to determine your compatibility with those members. Using this information, eharmony will send you partner recommendations (“matches”), which will appear in your online profile and be sent via email. This information will be provided to you as a condensed profile of the other compatible members, each containing a short description of a match, your compatibility score, along with your match's primary profile photo. Please note that, as a Basic member, you will only be able to view blurred versions of your matches' profile photos. However, you may be able to see an unblurred version of your matches' primary profile photos in some instances, at our discretion. As a Basic member, you will then be able to send as many predefined communications (for example, a smile, etc.) to other members as you want; however, you will only have a limited ability to send and read personalized messages. Please note that we may limit the number of predefined communications that you can send if required to protect our members and to secure our Service as further set out in this Agreement. As a Basic member, you will not receive a free copy of your personality profile, but you may purchase a PDF copy of the personality profile at the price listed on the Service at the time of purchase.
b. Premium Membership. The Singles Service includes a membership option that offers features not available under a Basic Membership, for which you will need to purchase a subscription (“Premium Membership”). If you purchase a Premium Membership, you will regularly receive updated matches from eharmony in your online profile and via email. These matches will be continuously updated to include new members who have been added to our database since you became a Premium member. As a Premium member, you will be able to see unblurred match photos (primary and any additional photos), contact and initiate communication with matches (including video chat), conduct searches for matches based on specific criteria (e.g., distance) and respond to matches’ communications without restriction (including video chat). Please note that we may still limit the number of communications that you can send if required to protect our members and to secure our Service as further set out in this Agreement. eharmony will also provide each Premium member his or her personality profiles as a PDF file by email.
c. Subscription. To become a Premium member, you will be required to pay a subscription fee. All prices listed by us on the Service are offered in the displayed currency and exclude applicable taxes and duties. eharmony currently offers 6, 12, and 24-month Premium Memberships which automatically renew for consecutive12 month terms (or other term lengths, as agreed-upon by you during the purchase process) unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of your current term. When purchasing a Premium Membership, you will be asked to supply certain payment information, including information regarding your billing account (e.g., via credit card, debit card, or PayPal account number.) You agree that all information that you provide to us will be accurate, complete and current. You further agree that our payment processing service provider(s) may store and communicate with your financial institution via a “network token” (a unique personal identifier used only for billing purposes) to facilitate your payments. For more information about tokenization, please see our payment processor’s explanation on its website. You agree to pay all valid charges incurred by you or any other user of your account (including all installment payments and/or fees, if applicable) and/or any fees for the use of any payment mechanism or account connected to your eharmony subscription, including any applicable taxes and processing charges, if any, relating to your subscriptions. If any problems arise with the billing account or credit or debit card associated with your subscription (for example, the payment method cannot be verified, is invalid or is otherwise not acceptable)), our payment processor will automatically reschedule the billing date until the amount due is paid in full. If these attempts fail and/or the issue(s) cannot be resolved by contacting the account and/or card issuer, we will notify you via email using the email address associated with your account requesting that you resolve the problem, and may suspend or terminate your subscription. However, you acknowledge and agree that we may first attempt to obtain updated billing information, including but not neccessarily limited to credit or debit card numbers and/or expiration date information from your card issuer, and to update this information in your account and use such information to process future payments. By subscribing, you authorize us and our payment processors to store and/or transfer your payment details and all other relevant information as needed to facilitate the processing of payments. You may select to purchase a plan in one upfront payment or in installments, if applicable. You agree and authorize us to charge you applicable sales or other related taxes to which your subscription may be subject and which may vary from time to time.
d. Access to Services and subscription using Non-eharmony Services. You may download an eharmony Application and purchase a Premium Membership using your Apple ID or Google account (each, a “Non-eharmony Service”) and use the Application on your iPhone or Android mobile device. Any subscriptions purchased through a Non-eharmony Service will be charged by the Non-eharmony Service and will be subject to the terms of your selected Premium Membership and the applicable terms of service of the Non-eharmony Service. Premium Memberships purchased through the Non-eharmony Services are subject to the payment terms agreed upon by you upon subscription. To cancel auto-renewal or terminate a Premium Membership purchased through a Non-eharmony Service, you must access your Non-eharmony Service account and follow the prompts and instructions for cancellation on the applicable service or contact the applicable service directly. If you are eligible for a refund for a payment processed by a Non-eharmony Service, such refund will be processed by Apple or Google, depending on the service usedyou may cancel the subscription by contacting eharmony. Additional information on cancellation is provided in Section 12 of this Agreement.
e. Exclusive Use. Your account is for your personal use only. You may not authorize others to use your account, and you may not assign or otherwise transfer your account to any other person or entity, except if previously agreed to by us.

14. Governing Law & Venue
Unless prohibited by local law, this Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Section 15 of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to limit a party’s right to seek equitable relief at any time. If the Arbitration Agreement (as set forth in Section 15) is held to be unenforceable, you agree that any claims or disputes that you have against us must be resolved in the federal or state courts located in Los Angeles, CA to the extent permissible by applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims appropriately brought in small claims court may be filed in any court of competent jurisdiction. For the sake of clarity, the choice of California law shall not exclude, limit or supersede a consumer’s rights or remedies under mandatory consumer protection laws in the jurisdiction where the consumer resides.
15. Arbitration Agreement, Class Action Waiver and Jury Trial Waiver
a. Purpose: This section 15 of the Agreement (henceforth referred to as “Arbitration Agreement") facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any Disputes that may arise between you and eharmony. Arbitration is a form of private Dispute (as defined below) resolution in which parties to a contract agree to submit their Disputes and potential Disputes to a neutral third person (called an arbitrator) for a binding decision, instead of having such Dispute(s) decided in a lawsuit, in court, by a judge or jury trial.
Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It provides that all Disputes between you and eharmony shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration replaces the right to go to court. In the absence of this Arbitration Agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions). Entering into this Arbitration Agreement constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims in court and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow this Arbitration Agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s fees, if otherwise authorized by applicable law).
For the purpose of this Arbitration Agreement, “eharmony” means eHarmony, Inc. and its parents, subsidiaries, and affiliated companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents. The term “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and eharmony regarding any aspect of your relationship with eharmony, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, gross negligence or reckless behavior), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Arbitration Agreement (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver in this Arbitration Agreement). “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced.
YOU AND EHARMONY EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.
b. Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution: For all Disputes you must first give eharmony an opportunity to resolve the Dispute. You must commence this process by mailing written notification to P.O. Box 241810, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA. That written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of the Dispute, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek. If eharmony does not resolve the Dispute to your satisfaction within 45 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration.
c. Arbitration Procedures: If this Arbitration Agreement applies and the Dispute is not resolved as provided above (“Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution”) either you or eharmony may initiate arbitration proceedings. The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), www.adr.org will arbitrate all Disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a representative or class arbitration. All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Arbitration Agreement.
For arbitration before the AAA, for Disputes of less than $75,000 USD, the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules will apply; for Disputes involving $75,000 USD or more, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. In either instance, the AAA’s Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. This Arbitration Agreement governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules. Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.
Because your contract with eharmony, the Agreement, and this Arbitration Agreement concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all Disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.
d. Arbitration Award: The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The arbitrator shall make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such award by the arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.
e. Location of Arbitration: You may initiate arbitration in Los Angeles, CA, via written submissions, in the federal judicial district that includes your address that you provide in your written notification of Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution, or in another location mutually agreed to by the parties.
f. Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs: Absent a finding that your demand is frivolous, brought for an improper purpose, or malicious as set forth by the standards of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), eharmony will pay all arbitration filing fees and arbitrator’s costs and expenses upon your written request given prior to the commencement of the arbitration. You are responsible for all additional fees and costs that you incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or expert witnesses. Fees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law. In addition to any rights to recover fees and costs under applicable law, if you provide notice and negotiate in good faith with eharmony as provided in the section above titled “Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution” and the arbitrator concludes that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover from eharmony your actual and reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.
g. Class Action Waiver: The parties agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, representative action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both you and eharmony specifically agree in writing to do so following initiation of the arbitration. Neither you, nor any other Registered Member of eharmony and/or user of eharmony services, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, representative, consolidated or private attorney general proceeding.
h. Limitation of Procedural Rights: You understand and agree that, by entering into this Arbitration Agreement, you and eharmony are each agreeing to arbitration instead of the right to a trial before a judge or jury in a public court. In the absence of this Arbitration Agreement, you and eharmony might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring Disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions). You give up those rights. Other rights that you would have if you went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited in arbitration. The right to appellate review of an arbitrator’s decision is much more limited than in court, and in general an arbitrator’s decision may not be appealed for errors of fact or law.
i. Severability: If any clause within this Arbitration Agreement (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Arbitration Agreement, and the remainder of this Arbitration Agreement will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then this entire Arbitration Agreement will be unenforceable, and the Dispute will be decided by a court.
j. Continuation: This Arbitration Agreement shall survive the termination of your contract with eharmony and your use of eharmony Services.
16. General Provisions
a. Right to Seek Injunction. Violation of this Agreement may cause eharmony irreparable harm, and therefore agree that eharmony will be entitled to seek extraordinary relief in court, including but not limited to temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions without the necessity of posting a bond or other security, in addition to and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that eharmony may have for a breach of this Agreement.
b. Miscellaneous. This Agreement, which you accept upon registration for the Services, the Privacy Policy located on the Services, and any applicable payment, renewal, additional Services terms, comprise the entire agreement between you and eharmony regarding the use of this Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and eharmony related to your use of the Services (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of this Agreement). The FAQ's found on the Services are for informational purposes only and are not deemed to be part of this Agreement. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, the Agreement will survive termination of your registration to the Services. The failure of eharmony to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement does not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect. The section titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
