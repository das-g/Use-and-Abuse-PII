K. Disputes and Jurisdiction:
1. The Service is based in the United States. It is not designed, customized or intended for, or directed to, any other country. Those who choose to access, visit and/or use the Service do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.

2. In any dispute between us, your sole remedy is to stop using your account/profile and/or the Service. This includes any dispute related to or arising out of: (i) rules, restrictions, limitations, terms and conditions that apply to the Service, whether listed in this User Agreement and Privacy Policy, posted at various points in the Service, or otherwise communicated to you, including our enforcement, non-enforcement, or application of any such rules; (ii) any of our policies and/or practices, including our enforcement, non-enforcement, or application of any such policies and/or practices; (iii) any Content available on or through the Service, or any edits, deletions, additions, or other changes thereto; or (iv) your ability or inability to access, visit and/or use portions of the Service, or the Service as a whole, or features, functionality, and/or Content available on or through the Service.
3. You agree that in the event of any dispute between us, you will first contact us and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation any court action. If we have a dispute that we are unable to resolve, you and Carvana agree to binding arbitration using the American Arbitration Association or J.A.M.S. You may send a demand for arbitration to either of the following:
American Arbitration Associate (AAA)
13455 Noel Road, Suite 1750
Dallas, TX 75240
www.adr.org
(972) 702-8222
J.A.M.S./Endispute
700 11th Street, NW, Suite 450
Washington, DC 20001
www.jamsADR.com
(800) 352-5267
The applicable rules of the arbitration forum you select will apply. You are giving up your right to a trial by jury or class action or similar relief. You have all other rights and remedies under applicable law. We will not object if you wish to use small claims court. An arbitration administrator and arbitrator may waive or reduce its fees for financial hardship. If you ask in writing, we will pay all administrator and arbitrator fees up to $2,500 that the administrator will not waive for any claims you assert in good faith. We will consider in good faith your request to pay all or part of any administrator or arbitrator fees over $2,500. The arbitration will occur at the closest AAA or J.A.M.S. office to where you live.
You have the right to reject this arbitration agreement, in which event neither you nor we will have the right to require arbitration of any disputes. Rejection of this arbitration agreement will not affect any other aspect of your contract. In order for you to reject this arbitration agreement, we must receive a signed writing ("Rejection Notice") from you within 30 days of the day you enter into the contract, stating that you reject the arbitration agreement. The Rejection Notice must include your name, address and Customer Number and must be mailed to us at: Attn: Carvana Legal, 1930 W Rio Salado Pkwy, Tempe, AZ 85281 by mail, return receipt requested. Upon receipt of your Rejection Notice, we will refund your postage cost. If you reject this arbitration agreement, that will not constitute a rejection of any other arbitration agreement between you and us.
4. We reserve the right, in addition to our other remedies, to take any technical, legal, and/or other action(s) that we deem necessary and/or appropriate, to prevent or correct violations and enforce the Terms of Use. You acknowledge and agree that we have the right hereunder to an injunction without posting a bond to stop or prevent a breach or violation of your obligations under the Terms of Use.
5. You agree that, regardless of where you access, visit and/or use the Service, all issues concerning the construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of the Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States, in the particular State where the Service is headquartered, without regard to any principles of conflict of laws. Any disputes that are not arbitrated or otherwise result in court action will be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in the U.S. State where the Service is headquartered, and you specifically consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and waive any claim of forum non-conveniens. Should there be a conflict between the laws of the U.S. State where the Service is headquartered, and any other laws, the conflict will be resolved in favor of the laws of such U.S. State where the Service is headquartered. To the extent permitted by applicable law, all judgments or awards shall be limited to actual out-of-pocket damages (excluding attorneys' fees) and shall not include any indirect, punitive, incidental and/or consequential damages.
6. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of the Agreement, or portion thereof, to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision or portion will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of the Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable in full force and effect.
L. General:
1. We reserve the right to post, from time to time, additional rules that apply to certain portions of the Service, or the Service as a whole. Such additional rules will be posted in the relevant portions of the Service, and are hereby incorporated into the Agreement by this reference. Your continued access, visitation and/or use of the Service constitutes your agreement to comply with these additional rules.
2. The rules, restrictions, limitations, terms and conditions that apply to the Service, whether listed in this User Agreement and Privacy Policy, posted at various points in the Service, or otherwise communicated to you, constitutes the Agreement and entire understanding between the parties, and supersedes prior agreements between the parties, whether oral or written, with respect to the subject matter hereof. Unless explicitly stated in writing by us, any new or additional features, functionality, or Content that augment or enhance the Service, including the release of updates, upgrades, new products and/or services, shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement.
3. Any delay or failure by us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. No waiver by us shall have effect unless such waiver is set forth in writing, signed by us; nor shall any such waiver of any breach or default constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default.
4. We may sub-license, transfer, sell or assign the Agreement, and/or any of our purported obligations hereunder, at any time to any person or entity, with or without notice. You may not sub-license, transfer, sell, or assign the Agreement at any time to any person or entity, and any attempt to do so will be null and void.
