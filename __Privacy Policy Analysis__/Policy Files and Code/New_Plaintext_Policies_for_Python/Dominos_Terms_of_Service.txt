Arbitration
BECAUSE OF THE MUTUAL BENEFITS (SUCH AS REDUCED EXPENSE AND INCREASED EFFICIENCY) WHICH PRIVATE BINDING ARBITRATION CAN PROVIDE, BOTH YOU AND DOMINO’S PIZZA AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE, AND/OR CONTROVERSY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR USE OF THE WEB SITES OR THE APPLICATIONS, ANY PRODUCTS SOLD BY DOMINO’S PIZZA THROUGH THE WEBSITES OR THE APPLICATIONS, THESE TERMS OF USE, OR THE SCOPE OR VALIDITY OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT SHALL BE SUBMITTED TO AND RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY BY BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT, EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY ASSERT CLAIMS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT IF YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY. ALL MATTERS RELATING TO ARBITRATION WILL BE GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT, 9 U.S.C. SECTIONS 1‐16, AND NOT BY ANY STATE ARBITRATION LAW.

Any arbitration pursuant to the Privacy Policy or Terms of Use shall be initiated with and conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in accordance with the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, both of which may be obtained at http://www.adr.org or by calling (800)778‐7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in Washtenaw County, Michigan. Nothing herein shall prevent Domino’s Pizza or you from obtaining from a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunctive relief to preserve the status quo or to prevent any irreparable harm pending the arbitration of the underlying claim, dispute, and/or controversy.

The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted by a single arbitrator. In addition to any requirements imposed by law, the arbitrator shall be a retired state or federal court judge, or a licensed attorney with arbitration experience and at least ten years’ experience as a lawyer, and shall be subject to disqualification on the same grounds as would apply to a judge of a court in the relevant jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall follow controlling law and issue a decision in writing within 45 days of the arbitration hearing with a supporting opinion based on applicable law. The decision of the arbitrator (the “Decision”) shall be final, binding, and conclusive on the parties and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction; provided, however, that You and Domino’s agree that the Decision may be appealed pursuant to the AAA’s Optional Appellate Arbitration Rules (“Appellate Rules”), which may be obtained at http://www.adr.org or by calling (800)778‐7879. The Decision shall not be considered final until after the time for filing the notice of appeal pursuant to the Appellate Rules has expired. Appeals must be initiated within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Decision, as defined by Rule A-3 of the Appellate Rules, by filing a Notice of Appeal with any AAA office. The single appellate arbitrator, who shall be chosen in the same manner described above, shall review the Decision applying the same standard(s) of review applicable in civil cases in the relevant jurisdiction and shall issue a reasoned award. The appellate arbitrator’s decision shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties, and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. At either party’s election, such decision and supporting opinion may be appealed to another arbitrator (“appellate arbitrator”), who shall be chosen in the same manner as described above. The appellate arbitrator shall apply to the underlying decision and opinion the same standard for review of civil cases as an appellate court in the relevant jurisdiction and issue a decision in writing with a supporting opinion based on such review and applicable law. The appellate arbitrator’s decision shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT ON A CLASS-WIDE, COLLECTIVE, MULTIPLE‐PARTY, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL BASIS. WE ALSO AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION PROCEEDING BETWEEN US MAY NOT BE CONSOLIDATED WITH ANY OTHER ARBITRATION BETWEEN DOMINO’S AND ANY OTHER PERSON. YOU AND DOMINO’S PIZZA BOTH UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION, BOTH ARE GIVING UP THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY INDIVIDUAL, CLASS-WIDE, COLLECTIVE, MULTIPLE‐PARTY, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR OTHER CLAIM EITHER MAY HAVE AGAINST THE OTHER, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN.

California Transparency in Supply Chains Act
As a company philosophy, Domino's Pizza, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates ("Domino's Pizza") strongly oppose any and all illegal and unethical treatment of individuals, including acts of slavery or human trafficking. Domino's Pizza utilizes a standard agreement that requires its suppliers to comply with all applicable laws, which includes applicable labor laws. Domino's Pizza also provides to its suppliers a Code of Ethics that similarly notifies suppliers of their obligation to comply with all applicable laws and also provides a dedicated avenue for reporting any illegal or unethical behavior. Domino's Pizza conducts periodic assessments of its suppliers and is determining whether to expand this assessment to obtain information about its suppliers' activities related to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010. Domino's Pizza is also considering implementing requests for certification from its suppliers and/or audits of its suppliers. At this time, Domino's Pizza does not plan to utilize a third party to perform any verifications or audits. Domino's Pizza also expects to evaluate whether training and/or changes in accountability standards and procedures for its employees and/or contractors are appropriate.
