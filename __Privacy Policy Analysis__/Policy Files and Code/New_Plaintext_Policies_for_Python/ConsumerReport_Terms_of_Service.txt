By Consumer Reports
Last updated: July 02, 2020
    
This page contains the User Agreement ("Agreement") between you and Consumer Reports, Inc. ("CR"), the nonprofit publisher of this Consumer Reports Web site (the "Site"). The term "Site" as it is used in this Agreement includes any associated online and mobile websites, applications and digital tools (including those related to our consumer policy and mobilization activities) that provide an authorized link to this Agreement ("Mobile Services"). You may wish to print this page for reference.

In this Agreement, "you" and "your" refer to each user of the Site and the Mobile Services.

This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions for your use of the Site and the Mobile Services.  By using the Site and/or the Mobile Services, you are agreeing to these terms and conditions.  Please read them carefully.

Please review our Privacy Policy which is a part of this Agreement and describes how CR treats your personal information.

1. Your Rights.
CR grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited right to access, use and display the Site and the Mobile Services and the materials provided thereon, and to download or print content displayed on our Site provided that you comply fully with this Agreement. The contents of the Site and the Mobile Services are only for your personal, non-commercial use. You agree not to interrupt, or attempt to interrupt, the operation of the Site or the Mobile Services or any part of them in any way.

2. Automatic Renewal Services, Service Charges and Payment.
CR may charge you fees for certain products or services offered for sale through our Site or the Mobile Services. Certain Site and Mobile Services products and services are available only through the purchase of a membership or subscription ("Paid Services") or other type of paid access. Some Paid Services may be billed either monthly or once annually. You agree to pay, using a valid credit or debit card or other payment method which CR accepts, all fees and charges, including applicable taxes, you have incurred through your account, including the monthly or annual charges to access the Paid Services. The terms for the Mobile Services are described in Section 16 below. The terms for CR's other Paid Services are described in this Section 2. 

(a) AUTOMATIC RENEWAL SERVICES: In order to provide you with uninterrupted service, most of our online Paid Services such as Consumer Reports digital and print Paid Services such as Consumer Reports magazine or print membership (when purchased online) renew automatically at the end of the applicable subscription or membership period at the rate then in effect. We alert you at the point of offer when a product or service is offered on an auto-renewing basis. As explained below, CR will automatically charge your credit or debit card or other payment method on file for an auto-renewing Paid Service unless you cancel the product or service by going to your Account Settings, logging in with your username and password, and then selecting "cancel membership." Your Account Settings can be accessed through a link in the footer of any page on ConsumerReports.org.   If you purchase a Paid Service on an annual basis, you will be sent a reminder notice before the expiration of your term that alerts you to the upcoming renewal charge.
(b) Cancelling Services: You may cancel your Paid Services at any time subject to the following terms:

If you purchase a one-year Paid Service, which is billed once annually at the time you purchase the Paid Service, you may cancel at any time during that Paid Service year by logging in to your "Account Settings" and selecting "cancel membership." Upon cancellation, CR will refund the remainder of your Paid Service fees on a pro-rata basis that will cover the unused months of your Paid Service. Partial months will not be refunded. Your access to a Paid Service will terminate on the next monthly anniversary of your purchase date. For example, if you purchased a one-year Paid Service on January 15 and cancel on May 10, your access will terminate on May 15 and you will obtain a refund for the period May 15 - January 14. If you purchase a one-year Paid Service you may also cancel by calling us at 800-333-0663.

If you purchase a Paid Service which is billed monthly, you may cancel at any time by logging in to your "Account Settings" page and selecting "cancel membership." Partial months will not be refunded. Upon cancellation, your access to an online Paid Service will terminate on the next monthly anniversary of your purchase date. For exampe, if you purchase the monthly Paid Service on December 15 and cancel on December 28, your access will terminate on January 14.

If you purchase a print Paid Service online, you may cancel at any time during the Paid Service subscription or membership year by following these steps: go to the "Account Settings" page, click "Print members sign in here." Then "sign in with your account number", enter your Login information (you'll need your account number listed on your publication issue and your Zip Code), click "Print Membership", click "Manage My Membership", and select "Cancel." Upon cancellation, CR will refund you the remainder of your print Paid Service fees on a pro rata basis based on the number of print issues which have not yet been mailed to you. In addition to cancelling a Print Paid Service through your "Account Settings" page, you may also write to us at Consumer Reports, Member Services, P.O. Box 5788, Harlan, IA 51593-1288. Alternatively, you can call us at 1-800-333-0663.

(c) Payment Amount: CR reserves the right to increase fees and surcharges, including fees for Paid Services, or to institute new fees at any time, upon reasonable notice posted in advance on this Site or sent to you based on contact information you provide in your Account Settings. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you purchase a Paid Service on an annual basis, your rate remains in effect throughout the membership or subscription year, and is subject to increase only for subsequent membership or subscription years. If you purchase a Paid Service on a monthly basis, the rate for that Paid Service is subject to change at any time for subsequent months, effective upon prior notice to you.

(d) Updating Payment Information: If you are enrolled in an auto-renewing Paid Services, you must update your credit or debit card or other payment information promptly to keep your account current, complete and accurate (e.g., for changes in your credit card number, billing address or expiration date).

If your credit or debit card or other payment method information is not current, complete and accurate and you do not notify us promptly when such information changes, your account may be suspended or terminated. In order to avoid service interruption and as a convenience to you, if you do not notify us of updates to your credit or debit card information (e.g., updated account status, payment card number and expiration date), we may try to update your credit or debit card information, either directly or indirectly through third party payment card updating services supported by your card provider, and you authorize us to continue billing your account with the updated information that we obtain. Such updater services may not be available for all credit or debit cards or other payment methods, and you should check with your card issuer to determine eligibility.

You may update your Registration Information at any time through the My Account feature by clicking the My Account link located at the top of the ConsumerReports.org home page and logging in with your username and password.

In the event of a breach of security on your part, you will remain liable for any unauthorized use of your Paid Service or other product or service until you update your Registration Information.
