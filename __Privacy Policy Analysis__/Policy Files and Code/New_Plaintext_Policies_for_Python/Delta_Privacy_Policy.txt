•	information regarding potential exposure to COVID-19 or other global pandemic; 
•	information collected by our ground or reservations staff pursuant to directives by public health organizations or other government agencies.
We use this information to:
•	comply with legal and regulatory requirements; 
•	determine your fitness to travel consistent with applicable government regulations and guidelines.
We use this information because:
•	we must comply with certain regulatory requirements regarding public health;
•	we have a legitimate business interest in ensuring the health and safety of passengers traveling on Delta flights;
•	we have a legitimate business interest in complying with applicable legal and regulatory requirements;
•	we need to use this information to perform our contract with you to provide flights.
We only base our use of personal data on our legitimate interests when we consider that our legitimate interest is not overridden by the individual's interests or rights in the data.
Please note that where you have provided your consent to us for processing your information, you can withdraw this at any time as described in section 8.
4.2. Information collected through our App
We use push notification tokens in the App to send notifications to your mobile device with updates for flight times, gate changes, and flight cancellations. The App will activate your camera if you choose to take a picture for a parking reminder, and will store the photo for you to look at later. If you choose, the App can access your device calendar to save itinerary information in your personal schedule. It can also bring up your default e-mail program, so you can send notes and reminders while traveling.
At times, we may promote the App via internet advertising on external websites. If you click on these advertisements and navigate directly to a third party application or other platform, information such as your phone’s device identification number may be sent to the advertising network, so that they and we may track the effectiveness of our advertising. This information might also be used for capping the number of times a specific visitor to a website is shown a particular advertisement, estimating the number of unique users, debugging, or security and fraud detection.
4.3. Legal requirements and professional advice
We may also use your personal information where this is necessary to comply with a reasonable request by a law enforcement or regulatory authority, body, or agency, or in the defense of legal claims.

We may also use your personal information when obtaining legal and other professional advice including for audits. We consider this to be in our legitimate interest in the management of our business.
4.4. What if you do not provide information?
In some cases, we are legally required to collect certain information from you so we can provide the services you have requested, such as Secure Flight Passenger Data or Advance Passenger Information when you make a reservation to fly within, into, or out of the United States, or for point-to-point international travel. Failure to provide this information will mean we cannot provide the service.

In some circumstances we need your information to perform our contract with you or to provide products and services, such as payment details and, on occasion, credit checking information. If you do not provide this information, we may not be able to enter into or perform the contract or provide the products and services.
4.5. Authorization on behalf of another passenger
When you provide information to us about your travel companions or other individuals (if, for example, you have arranged to make a booking on their behalf), you confirm to us that you have obtained their authorization to provide us their information and their consent to your use of their information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you cannot make these confirmations, you must not provide us with any personal information about these individuals.
4.6. Sensitive Information
We may collect or receive sensitive or special categories of personal information, such as that relating to health, disabilities, race, ethnicity, political opinions, biometrics, or religion, where permitted by applicable law. For example, we may collect and receive sensitive personal information from you when you:
•	provide such information to us, a travel agent, or another third party involved in your travel arrangements at the time of or following your booking;
•	disclose to us that you have a specific medical condition, will have an accompanying service animal, or request specific medical care or assistance, such as the provision of an accompanying nurse or wheelchair assistance, from us, an airport, or a third party involved in your travel arrangements;
•	make a request that implies or suggests something about you which could be interpreted as sensitive personal information, such as a request for a specific type of meal that may suggest that you have a certain medical condition or hold a particular religious belief;

•	consent to the collection of your digital image to enable our supplier's facial recognition system for lounge access purposes; or
•	provide information requested by public health authorities or other government agencies as contemplated by 4.1.j.
By providing any personal information that is or could be sensitive personal information, you agree that you have given us your consent to collect, store, use, and transfer this personal information for the purposes for which it was provided and otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
We occasionally receive personal information from law enforcement agencies and other sources relating to criminal activity (or alleged criminal activity) and may use that information where necessary, and where permitted by applicable law, to detect or prevent unlawful activity occurring during air travel. We consider this to be in the substantial public interest.
5. Data Retention
We store your information for as long as legally required or for so long as necessary to support business purposes described in section 4 and consistent with our record retention policies. In general, this storage will be (i) at least for the duration of our relationship, (ii) for as long as you can bring a claim against us and for us to be able to defend ourselves, and (iii) for any period required by tax, aviation, and other applicable laws and regulations.
Our App will store user-provided data for as long as you use the related feature of the App, unless you choose to delete the App. Only information provided for travel clearance, purchases, and related activities will be stored in our operational systems as needed to provide your requested services.

Required Cookies are essential for basic and enhanced website functionality and performance.  Without these cookies, services you have asked for and choices you have made for better functionality and features cannot be provided.
These cookies, such as those used for Google Analytics, collect information on how users use our Website, in order to help us fix technical issues or errors, and highlight areas such as navigation where we can improve our Website. For example, Google Analytics uses cookie identifiers to track the number of visitors to the Website, providing us with the volumes and sources of web page traffic.  This allows us to analyse web traffic patterns and run tests to optimize web pages and visits against key metrics.
These cookies, such as language preference, help us customize our Website content based on a user's preferences. They remember the user's choices, their language, the country pages visited, and any changes the user makes to text size or other parts of our Website pages. The information these cookies collect may be anonymized and they cannot track browsing activity on other websites.
These cookies, such as jsessionid, xssid, xssidsec, and dlsite, are essential for parts of our Website or App to operate. They enable users to move around our Website and allow us to recognize a user within our Website or using our App, so that we can provide users with service they asked for, such as remembering the user's sign-in details.  They are required to maintain a record of your Do Not Track preferences, so that we may respect them for future visits.

We may use other cookies, such as those used by advertising platforms we may use, such as Facebook or Twitter, to target and re-target visitors to our Website and App with digital advertising that is most relevant to the user.  These cookies are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement or particular content, as well as help measure the effectiveness of an advertising or marketing campaign. Using existing cookies from many sites already on your computer, we partner with third party companies to deliver advertising to specific computers.
The information collected by Google Analytics itself is anonymous, but if you respond to a marketing email, then a random ID is generated for Google Analytics which we can use along with your email address to manually identify you from other information we already hold in your customer profile. We may then use this information to generate potential sales leads or advertising.

7. With Whom Does Delta Share Your Information?
7.1. In general
We do not sell your name or other personal information to third parties, and do not intend to do so in the future.
We may disclose your information we collect or receive:
•	To third parties to process your information on our behalf, or to assist us in providing our services and/or products, such as our customer care center operators and providers of technical services such as data centers, biometric verification services, and online tools; however, Delta requires that third parties comply with Delta’s Privacy Policy when processing your information. 

•	To the party providing the service or product when you request or purchase services or products through Delta that are to be provided by another party (for example, a travel segment on another carrier, hotel accommodations, or rental car).

•	To you or those acting on your behalf. Where local regulations require, we may obtain your consent in writing for the purpose of allowing someone else to act on your behalf.

•	To our SkyMiles Partners, Promotional Partners and other Delta Group Companies for the purposes described in and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

•	To other airlines, including members of our SkyTeam alliance, for the purpose of servicing your travel, servicing your flight reservation, recognizing your frequent flyer status, or rebooking your flight in the event of an unexpected disruption in your travel, or protecting crewmembers, customers, and the overall safety and security of our flight operations and those of our alliance partners.

•	where your SkyMiles Program account is associated with your employer’s or corporate business account, to that employer or company, to third party expenses administration providers, to suppliers of corporate travel assistance services, to travel agencies and corporate travel managers through which your travel was arranged, and to duty of care providers.

•	To banks, financial firms and payment services for the purposes of processing payments and refunds.

•	To government agencies and authorities, law enforcement officials, law courts, or to third parties: (a) if we believe disclosure is required by applicable law, regulation or legal process (such as pursuant to a subpoena or judicial order); or (b) to protect and defend our rights, or the rights or the rights, health, or safety of third parties, including to establish, make, or defend against legal claims; or (c) in the interest of public health and safety.

•	To customs and immigrations authorities, which require by law access to booking and travel itinerary information including "Advanced Passenger Information" (passport and associated personal information) for all passengers prior to travel.

•	To passengers traveling under the same booking as you.

•	To persons providing services to Delta, including its professional advisers (e.g. auditors, lawyers, and technical consultants).

•	To persons with whom we are discussing selling any part of our business or to whom we sell any part of our business.
We may share with third parties anonymous, aggregated information about all our users.

If your ticket is purchased pursuant to a corporate incentive agreement, we may disclose information concerning your travel to your employer or corporate travel manager.
When you use the App, a unique ID (which varies by device manufacturer and operating system) is read from or associated with your device to be used as an anonymous identifier for analytics and performance purposes. This ID might be generated by or shared with third parties providing us with analytics services, such as Adobe.
7.2. Social Media and Messaging Platforms
You may wish to share information regarding your travel or other activities with Delta on social media and messaging platforms provided by third parties. To utilize social media and message sharing features, you will be prompted to grant permissions within those third-party platforms, as you choose. For example, you will need to allow account login and publishing permissions. If you choose to contact or interact with us on a third-party social media or messaging platform, you understand that you are responsible for reviewing and understanding the terms and conditions, information security practices, and privacy policy applicable to the third-party platform, and that Delta is not responsible for how third-party social media and messaging platforms use, share, or protect your information. The activity on third-party social media and messaging platforms, and the data processed, stored, and provided on them, including data regarding interactions with Delta, is governed by the terms and conditions, information security practices, and privacy policy of those third-party platforms.

7.3. Disclosure of personal information to passengers traveling under the same booking
When you make a booking, you will be provided with a booking reference such as a confirmation number or record locater number. Your booking reference should be kept confidential at all times. Disclosing your booking reference to other passengers may allow them to access your booking details through our systems. If you are travelling with others under the same booking and would not like your individual booking details to be disclosed to them, you may prefer to have each person make and pay for separate bookings.
7.4. Delta Biometrics optional facial recognition technology at participating airports
Our customers at certain participating airports including customers flying on Aeromexico, Air France-KLM or Virgin Atlantic, will have the option of using facial recognition technology when flying direct to an international destination to:
•	Check-in at the self-service kiosks in the lobby;
•	Drop checked baggage at the counters in the lobby;
•	Serve as identification at the TSA check point;
•	Board the aircraft at the departure gate; and
•	Go through U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) processing when arriving into the U.S. on an international flight.
Any Delta Biometrics experience or biometric test with Delta is optional. If you choose to use facial recognition at a participating airport, your image, once captured, is encrypted and sent to to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP). To protect the security and privacy of your image, no additional information, such as name, document number, or date of birth, is sent with the image. CBP uses your image to verify your identity by comparing your image against images associated with your passport, other travel documents, or prior CBP border inspections, and Delta receives confirmation of your identity from CBP. Delta does not retain your biometric information. If you are a U.S. citizen, CBP deletes your image following verification in accordance with CBP policy. For certain non-U.S. citizens, CBP uses your image as biometric confirmation of departure from the United States. For more information, visit www.CBP.gov or see CBP’s Privacy Impact Assessment for the Traveler Verification Service here:
https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhscbppia-056-traveler-verification-service-0.
Please note that Delta is not the data controller (as referred to in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), the UK GDPR and UK Data Protection Act 2018, the Brazilian General Data Protection Act (“LGPD”) and other applicable laws) of your image information as used by CBP as described above. Delta is the controller only of information used to verify your identity for the purposes of your boarding the flight.  
7.5. Contact Tracing
To promote healthy travel and prevent the spread of COVID-19, all Delta passengers entering the United States, including U.S. passport holders, are encouraged to provide contact tracing information. Participation in contact tracing is voluntary unless specified by a specific flight, country, city or region.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in collaboration with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) supports domestic COVID-19 control efforts by making contact information for international air passengers available to state and local health departments to contact you and provide follow-up instructions for testing and/or potential quarantine.  Delta shares this information with the CDC via CBP utilizing established channels for the Advance Passenger Information System (APIS).   For more information, go to www.CDC.gov, opens in a new window or www.CBP.gov, opens in a new window, or see CBP’s Privacy Impact Assessment for the Advance Passenger Information System, opens in a new window for details about how CBP uses APIS information.
7.6.   COVID Tested Flights
As part of the Delta CareStandardSM  and with guidance from trusted medical partners, Delta flights labeled as “COVID-Tested” require passengers to consent during purchase to COVID-19 testing and for select flights must also consent to submit contact tracing information as a condition of boarding the COVID-Tested flight.  For more information go to https://www.delta.com/us/en/travel-update-center/covid-tested-flights/italy-covid-tested-flights.  
COVID-19 testing: Information related to your COVID-19 test, including test results and related demographic information, such as your name, contact information and date of birth (“COVID-19 Test Information”), may be used for administration of Delta’s COVID-19 testing program, including, but not limited to, for purposes of monitoring, quality control, auditing, analysis, and reporting to a government authority, and you understand that your COVID-19 Test Information may be shared with Delta, any third party acting on Delta’s behalf in connection with COVID-19 Testing Program and any U.S. or non-U.S. local, state or national government agency or authority for public health reasons, or as otherwise required by applicable law.  Delta also collects contact tracing information for select Delta flights labeled as “COVID-Tested”; for more information, see section 7.5.

9. Your Rights
This section 9 applies only to individuals in the European Union, UK and other countries which grant the rights described here. These rights will apply only in certain circumstances.
9.1. Requesting a copy of your information
To the extent you are legally entitled, you can request confirmation of whether or not we process your personal information, and details of the information that we hold about you and how we use it.
You also have a right to access your personal information and to be provided with a copy.
9.2. Right to rectification of personal data
If you believe that the personal data we hold about you is inaccurate, you may request that we correct it. You may also request us to complete personal data about you which is incomplete.
9.3. Right to restrict processing of personal data
You have the right to request that we restrict processing of your personal information where one of the following applies:
•	You claim that the personal data is not accurate. The restriction will apply until we have taken steps to ensure the accuracy of the personal data.
•	The processing is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase the personal data.
•	We no longer require the personal data for the purposes of processing, but you still need it in connection with a legal claim.
•	You have exercised your right to object to the processing. The restriction will apply until we have taken steps to verify whether we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing
9.4. Right to request deletion of personal data ("right to be forgotten")
You may request the erasure, suspension of processing or anonymization of your personal information in certain circumstances. For example, you may request erasure, suspension of processing or anonymization if:
•	The personal information is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed.

•	You have withdrawn your consent and we have no other legal basis for processing the personal information.

•	 You have exercised your right to object to processing the personal information, and we have no overriding legitimate grounds to continue processing it.

•	The personal information is excessive for the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed. 
Under certain circumstances, we may refuse a request for erasure, suspension of processing or anonymization, for example, where we need to use the personal data to comply with a legal obligation or to establish, make or defend legal claims.

If you exercise your right to erasure or anonymization, this will potentially remove records which we hold for your benefit, such as your SkyMiles account information (including miles that may be in your SkyMiles account) and your presence on a marketing suppression list.
9.5. Right to object to processing of personal data
You have a right, at any stage, to object to our using your personal information to send you marketing information.

You also have the right to object to our using your personal information where our reason is based on our legitimate interests. We will have to stop processing until we can establish that we have compelling legitimate grounds which override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or that we need to continue using it for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.
9.6. Right to data portability
This right applies where:
•	Our reason for using your personal information is either that you have given consent or that the processing is necessary for us to perform a contract with you; and
•	We process the personal information by automated means.
This is a right to receive all the personal information which you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to transmit this to another controller directly, where this is technically feasible.
9.7. Complaints to regulator
You have a right to complain to a supervisory authority (i.e., a regulator which oversees data protection law compliance), for example, in the UK or the European Union country where you live or work or where you believe we have infringed your privacy rights.

In general, we do not charge any fee where the right is based on European Union law, UK law, the Brazilian General Data Protection law, and other applicable laws. (We can charge an administrative fee for extra copies of your information and in certain exceptional circumstances.) 
Where we receive a request to exercise one of these rights, we will provide information on the action we take on the request without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request. This time may be extended by a further two months in certain circumstances, for example, where requests are complex or numerous.
Where we do not carry out your request, we will tell you without delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request, and we will explain our reasons for not taking the action requested.
Any request you make must be in writing and include your name and address and any other information that may identify you, such as where your request relates to a travel booking, please provide your booking reference (e.g., confirmation number or record locater number), SkyMiles Account number if you have one, the dates on which the travel took place, and any other relevant information that will assist us to identify your booking. You must also provide a photocopy of your passport or driver’s license so we can verify your identity. Please send your written requests to:
Data Protection Officer
1030 Delta Blvd
Department 981

As regards Delta's personal data processing activities regulated by the GDPR, Delta has appointed its branch at Vertrekpassage 1 – 110, 1118 AP Schiphol, The Netherlands as its European Union representative.
10. Minors
Other than information required to complete a booking, Delta does not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If a child under 13 has provided us with personal information without parental or guardian consent, the parent or guardian may contact us by emailing us at Privacy@delta.com. We will remove the information and unsubscribe the child from any of our electronic marketing lists. Where required by applicable law, we may ask children for consent from their parents or guardians before we book their flight or provide a product or service to them.
11. Links
Our Website contains links to other sites. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of those sites, and Delta’s Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected from you by those sites. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each site that collects information from you. When you are leaving our Website via a link to interact with a site that is not governed by this Privacy Policy, a new browser window will open.
12. Information Security
Information Security is important to Delta. We have established appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial safeguards to protect the information we collect in accordance with this Privacy Policy. These safeguards are regularly reviewed to protect against unauthorized access, disclosure, and improper use of your information, and to maintain the accuracy and integrity of that data. In the event of a data breach, we adhere to data breach notification requirements and incident reporting obligations to supervising authorities and/or data subjects, as required by applicable laws. The substance and time frames applicable to these remedies are set forth in applicable laws.
13. Data Transfers
Delta is based in Atlanta, Georgia, USA and we may transfer personal information in compliance with applicable law to the US and other jurisdictions where Delta provides services.
For residents of the EU, UK, Nigeria and some other countries:  Some of the countries where Delta provides services may not have the equivalent level of data protection laws as those in your location. If we need to transfer personal data from your location to such countries, we will take steps to make sure your personal data continues to be protected and safeguarded. In particular, we require parties to whom we transfer your data to agree to abide by suitable contractual obligations, such as, in the case of transfers from the EU or UK,  the Model Clauses approved by the European Commission and permitted under Article 46 of the European Union General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") or the UK secretary of state or under other relevant body. If you would like to obtain the details of such safeguards, you can request them from the Data Protection Officer at Privacy@delta.com. In some limited circumstances, we may also transfer your information from your location to other countries where permitted by applicable law (for example under Article 49, GDPR in the case of transfers from the European Economic Area). This includes where it is necessary for the performance of a contract between us and you and where the transfer is necessary in connection with legal proceedings.
14. Promotional Partners
We want to give you more opportunities to earn miles in the Delta SkyMiles Program. One of the ways we do this is by sharing your information with Promotional Partners. Typically, these promotional offerings are limited in quantity and geographic reach and targeted to specific demographic audiences. If you fall within the audience a Promotional Partner is trying to reach, and (where required under applicable law) you have consented to receive information about their services, you may receive a promotional e-mail or direct mail. Although we select our partners with care, these partners have their own privacy policies that apply to the way they use your personal data.
If you do not want us to share your information with one of these partners, you can always opt out by contacting us by using the Email Us page or by calling the SkyMiles Service Center at +1-800-323- 2323.
15. SkyMiles Program
In addition to the Data Transfers explained in section 13, information you provide in connection with the SkyMiles Program (as summarized in the table at section 4.1.c.), may be transferred to Delta entities in other jurisdictions, including the Cayman Islands.  This may include sensitive information as defined under the Data Protection Law, 2017 of the Cayman Islands ("DPL"), the GDPR, the UK GDPR, or other applicable law if you have provided such information to Delta in connection with your SkyMiles account.
