Terms and Conditions

[Last Updated April 24, 2020]

Welcome to Best Buy. The BestBuy.com website, Best Buy mobile and iPad apps, and our mobile Best Buy site are collectively the “Best Buy Properties” and each individually is a “Best Buy Property.” By using any Best Buy Property and its related services, products, and software, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions (“Terms”). You also accept the Terms when you create an account, make a purchase as a guest, or log in to any Best Buy Property. Additional or separate terms may apply to your interactions with other Best Buy websites, Best Buy or Geek Squad® locations, and to your use of individual services or features available on a Best Buy Property, such as reviews. To the extent that the provisions of any additional terms conflict with these Terms, the provisions of the additional terms will govern. References to “Best Buy,” “Geek Squad,” “Magnolia,” “Magnolia Home Theater,” “Magnolia Design Center,” “Pacific Sales,” “our,” “we,” or “us” may refer to Best Buy Co., Inc., BestBuy.com, LLC, Best Buy Stores, L.P., BBY Solutions, Inc., Best Buy Enterprise Services, Inc., Magnolia Hi-Fi, LLC, Pacific Sales Kitchen and Bath Centers, LLC, and their affiliates, subsidiaries, and designees. We may make changes to any Best Buy Property and the Terms. It is your responsibility to review the Terms for updates or changes. If you do not agree with the Terms, you should not use the Best Buy Properties.
Use of the Best Buy Properties

You may use the Best Buy Properties for your personal, noncommercial use only. You may not use any Best Buy Property if you are under the age of 13. If you are between the ages of 13 and 18, you may use the Best Buy Properties only with involvement of a parent or guardian.
Privacy

Your use of the Best Buy Properties is subject to our Privacy Policy. Please review the policy for more on how we collect and use information.
Information on Our Site

We try to be as accurate as possible with the information we present on the Best Buy Properties. We will make reasonable efforts to accurately display the attributes of the products we sell. We do not warrant that product descriptions or other content is accurate, complete, or error free. Prices and promotions are subject to change, and may vary from those offered in our stores. We cannot confirm the availability or price of an item until you place your order. Despite our best efforts, sometimes an item in our catalog may not be available, the offer may have been misstated, or an item may be mispriced. For any of these reasons, we may cancel your order or we may contact you for instructions on the order.
Paying for Your Order

Generally, we’ll charge your payment method for an item when we ship the item to you or confirm its availability in store. For digital items, we’ll charge your payment method when you initiate the download of the product or the product is placed in your account and available for use. For special-delivery items, we’ll charge your payment method when you confirm a delivery time. However, we will preauthorize your order amount (including for pre-orders) with your payment method at the time you place the order, which may have an effect on your available credit line. If a preauthorization of a pre-order expires before fulfillment, the preauthorization will be reversed and another preauthorization will be made closer to the confirmed availability date. 

 
Order Confirmation

Our order confirmation to you does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. At any time after receipt of your order, we may accept, decline, or place quantity or other limits on your order for any reason. We may impose these limits on a per-person, per-household, per-order, or any other basis. If we reject, limit, or otherwise modify your order, we will attempt to notify you using the email address you provide to us. If we cancel an order or part of an order that we’ve already charged you for, we’ll refund you the full amount of the canceled portion of the order.
My Best Buy® Program

When you create an account on a Best Buy Property, we will automatically enroll you in the My Best Buy program. The My Best Buy program is a free program in which you receive points toward reward certificates, which are coupons for discounts on future purchases at Best Buy. See My Best Buy program terms.

Dispute Resolution by Binding Individual Arbitration

ANY DISPUTE INVOLVING YOU AND BEST BUY OR ANY OF ITS AGENTS SHALL BE RESOLVED THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE NOTED BELOW.

“Dispute” shall be interpreted broadly and include any claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to your relationship with Best Buy and its subsidiaries, affiliates, and designees — including, but not limited to, Geek Squad, Magnolia, and Pacific Sales — whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory. This includes (1) the My Best Buy® program; (2) In-Home Consultations; (3) use of Best Buy’s websites; (4) any service terms and conditions; and/or (5) any products or services offered, sold, or distributed by Best Buy including, but not limited to, the advertising of or the sales practices for such products and services. Dispute shall also include all disputes that arose before your enrollment in the My Best Buy® program and after the cancellation or termination of the My Best Buy® program, including any claims that are the subject of a purported class action litigation.

BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO MAINTAIN OTHER AVAILABLE RESOLUTION PROCESSES, SUCH AS A COURT ACTION OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING, TO SETTLE DISPUTES. THE RULES IN ARBITRATION ARE DIFFERENT. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, LESS DISCOVERY, AND LIMITED APPELLATE REVIEW. ARBITRATORS CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF THAT A COURT CAN AWARD.

Either Party may initiate an arbitration proceeding by sending a demand to the American Arbitration Association (AAA) that describes the basis for the claim. You may serve a copy of a demand on our registered agent CT Corporation System, Inc., 100 South Fifth Street, Suite 1075, Minneapolis, MN 55402. The arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules or Commercial Arbitration Rules (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as appropriate, and as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and the form for filing an arbitration claim are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules, however we will reimburse those fees (but not any attorney’s fees) for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Best Buy for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed upon location.

YOU AND BEST BUY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS MEANS THAT YOU MAY NOT PURPORT TO ACT ON BEHALF OF A CLASS OR ANY OTHER PERSON. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. The arbitrator may not award relief for or against anyone who is not a party to the arbitration proceeding. Further, unless both you and Best Buy agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If a court determines that public injunctive relief may not be waived and all appeals from that decision have been exhausted, then the parties agree that any claim for public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending arbitration of the remaining claims. If this specific paragraph is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this dispute resolution provision (except for the jury trial waiver) shall be null and void.

NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OF THE FOREGOING, ANY DISPUTE THAT FALLS WITHIN THE JURISDICTIONAL SCOPE AND AMOUNT OF AN APPROPRIATE SMALL CLAIMS COURT SHALL BE BROUGHT IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. IN ADDITION, EITHER PARTY MAY ELECT TO BRING AN ACTION IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION TO SEEK TO ENJOIN INFRINGEMENT OR OTHER MISUSE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

If for any reason a claim may proceed in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial, unless such waiver is unenforceable. This means that any claim would be decided by a judge, not a jury.

This dispute resolution section shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. It shall survive any termination or cancellation of, or your participation in, the Program. Any amendments to this dispute resolution section shall be prospective only and shall not affect any pending arbitration proceeding.
Applicable Law

THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT AND APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAW (OR IN THE ABSENCE OF APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAW, THEN THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA), WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICT OF LAWS, WILL GOVERN THESE TERMS AND APPLY TO ANY DISPUTES AGAINST BEST BUY.
