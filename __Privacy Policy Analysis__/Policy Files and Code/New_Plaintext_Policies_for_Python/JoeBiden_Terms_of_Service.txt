TERMS OF SERVICE
Last Revised: [4/19/2021]

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) apply to your access to and use of the websites and other online services (collectively, the “Services”) provided by the Democratic National Committee (the “DNC”, “we” or “us”). By accessing and using the Services, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Services.

We may provide additional or different terms and conditions with respect to some of the Services (“Additional Terms”). If you use any Services with Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will apply to your use of such Services. If there is any conflict between these Terms and any Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control to the extent of such conflict.

We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make any changes to these Terms, we will notify you by revising the “Last Revised” date at the top of these Terms and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as by adding a statement to our website homepage or by sending you a notification). Unless otherwise indicated in our notice to you, any changes to these Terms will be effective immediately, and your continued use of the Services following our provision of such notice will confirm your acceptance of such changes. If you do not agree to any changes to these Terms, you must stop using the Services.

If you have any questions regarding these Terms or the Services, please contact us at info@democrats.org.

Privacy Policy
For information about how we collect, use, and share information about you, please see our Privacy Policy.

Voter Registration and Assistance Tools
We offer certain voter registration and assistance tools through the Services (such as through our website, www.IWillVote.com), which help you to, e.g., check to see whether you are registered to vote, register to vote, and commit to vote. The voter registration tool available through the Services is intended to assist you in registering to vote by making available to you the applicable voter registration form for your state and providing an easy method for you to complete such form. However, you are solely responsible for properly completing the form and submitting it in a timely manner to the state in which you reside and are registering to vote. Although we work hard to see that the forms and information we provide on the Services are accurate, up-to-date and complete and that the tools we offer, such as the reminder feature, operate as intended, we cannot guarantee and make no representations regarding the accuracy or currency of such forms or information or of the operation of our tools. The voter registration and assistance tools, and all other tools and features we offer through the Services, as well as the information and materials on the Services, are provided “AS IS,” and you are solely responsible for assuring that any voter registration form you submit meets all of the requirements for your state and is properly submitted.

Mobile Communications
If you subscribe to receive updates or other information from us through our SMS text messaging program, you consent to receiving automated text messages from us via your mobile device. Subscribers will receive +2 messages a week from the DNC.

We do not charge for these services. However, your carrier’s normal messaging, data, and other rates and fees will still apply. You should check with your carrier to find out what plans are available and how much they cost. At any time, you may text STOP to cancel or HELP for customer support information. For all questions about the services provided by this short code, you can send an email to info@democrats.org.

Carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.

Severability
If any provision or portion of a provision of these Terms is deemed to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision or portion thereof is deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

Miscellaneous
Any failure by the DNC to enforce any provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision of these Terms, unless expressly waived in writing by the DNC. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Except as otherwise provided in these Terms, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.
