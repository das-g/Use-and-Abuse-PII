("CVS," "us" or "we"), which incorporates by this reference any additional terms and conditions posted by CVS through the Site, or otherwise made available to you by CVS. This Agreement does not govern your use of other sites or apps (including services on other sites or apps) operated by CVS, such as www.cvs.com/minuteclinic (the use of which is governed by separate terms and conditions, which are available at www.cvs.com/minuteclinic/info/terms-use). The information and resources contained on and accessible through the Service are made available by CVS and its suppliers and vendors, and other third parties, in each case subject to your agreement to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.

About our Health Content

Our health content describes general principles of health care that should not in any event be construed as specific instructions for individual patients. This material is not intended as a guide to self-medication or as a substitute for proper medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. It is for reference only and should not be used to determine treatment for specific medical conditions--only a health care provider can do that. The Service and its health related information and resources are not intended and must not be taken as the rendering of medical, nursing, or professional health care advice or services, or the practice of medicine, nursing, or professional health care in any jurisdiction. You should discuss the information provided with a physician, pharmacist, nurse, or other licensed health care professional. You should also check product information (including package inserts) regarding dosage, precautions, warnings, interactions, and contraindications before administering or using any device, drug, herb, vitamin, or supplement discussed on the Service.

You understand and agree that neither CVS nor its suppliers or vendors are responsible for any claim, loss, or damage directly or indirectly resulting from your use of the Service or the information resources contained on or accessible through the Service.

Proper treatment of health conditions depends upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, your medical history, diet, lifestyle, and medication regimen. Your health care provider can best assess and address your individual health care needs. You should consult with your health care provider before starting a new diet, fitness, or supplement regimen. IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING A MEDICAL CRISIS, PLEASE CALL 911 OR CONTACT YOUR LOCAL EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE SERVICE IMMEDIATELY.

Information and statements about dietary supplements have not been evaluated by the US Food and Drug Administration and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, mitigate, or prevent any disease or health condition. CVS does not endorse manufacturers' or others' claims about the efficacy of these products. We specifically disclaim any guarantee or warranty, express or implied, with respect to any products or services sold, including any warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. No information conveyed by CVS either orally or in writing shall create such a warranty.

Resale of products or services purchased in connection with the Service is specifically prohibited. We reserve the right to refuse to sell products or services to you if it reasonably appears to us that you intend to resell such products or services. Verification of information may be required prior to our acceptance of any order. We further reserve the right to limit quantities of items purchased by each customer or to refuse to provide any customer with any such items. Your properly completed and delivered order form constitutes your offer to purchase the goods or services referenced in your order. Your order shall be deemed to be accepted only if and when CVS or its supplier or vendor sends an order acceptance and shipping notice email to your email address.

Sweepstakes, giveaways, specials, sales, and other promotions offered at the Service may not be available in stores. Likewise, sales and specials offered in-store might not be reflected online.

Text Messaging Terms and Conditions

CVS Pharmacy, Inc. or one or more of its affiliates (CVS) offers access to pharmacy and healthcare service messages via recurring SMS (Short Message Service) and MMS (Multimedia Message Service) text alerts. Enrollment in text alerts requires a patient to provide his or her own mobile phone number with an area code within the 50 United States or the District of Columbia. By enrolling to receive CVS text alerts, you agree to these terms and conditions, which become effective upon your enrollment. You may be asked to verify your mobile phone number before the service will start. This requires responding to a text alert sent to your mobile phone confirming your enrollment in this Service.

You acknowledge that text alerts will be sent to the mobile phone number you provide to CVS. Such alerts may include limited personal information about your prescriptions, and whoever has access to the mobile phone or carrier account will also be able to see this information. Once you enroll, the frequency of text alerts we send to you will vary. You will typically receive text alerts when we have information for you about your prescriptions or other healthcare information. CVS Pharmacy does not impose a separate charge for text alerts; however, your mobile carrier's message and data rates may apply depending on the terms and conditions of your mobile phone contract. You are solely responsible for all message and data charges that you incur. Please contact your mobile service provider about such charges. The following carriers are supported: AT&T, Sprint, Boost, Verizon Wireless, U.S. CellularÂ®, T-MobileÂ®, Cincinnati Bell, Alltel, Virgin Mobile USA, Cellular South, Unicel, Centennial and nTelos. You may opt out of CVS text alerts at any time. To stop receiving text alerts, text STOP to CVSTXT (287898). Texting STOP to CVSTXT (287898) will opt you out of any and all future CVS text messages. After you submit a request to unsubscribe, you will receive one final text alert from CVS confirming that you will no longer receive text alerts. No additional text alerts will be sent unless you re-activate your enrollment. For questions about text alerts, text the word Help to CVSTXT (287898) or contact CVS at 1-877-833-9620. You also can change your text alert preferences on CVS.com if you have an account with prescription management. Sign in and go to your pharmacy main page. Click on the On/Off button in the Pharmacy Messages section to change your preferences.

The CVS text alert programs are offered on an "as is" basis and: (1) may not be available in all areas at all times; and (2) may not continue to work in the event of product, software, coverage or other service changes made by your wireless carrier. CVS may change or discontinue any of its text alert programs without notice or liability to you. CVS and its related companies and each of their respective officers, directors and employees are not responsible and shall not be liable for any losses or injuries of any kind resulting, directly or indirectly, from any CVS text alert program or from technical failures or delays of any kind. CVS reserves the right to cease delivery of text alerts to any person at anytime in its sole discretion.


Third Party Resources

The Service may contain links to, or otherwise make available, third-party sites, services, products, information, content, materials, merchandise, functionality and/or other resources ("Third Party Resources"). These links and access are provided for your convenience and reference only. We do not control such Third Party Resources and, therefore, we are not responsible for such Third Party Resources, or any content posted on or made available by such Third Party Resources. Be aware that CVS does not control, makes no guarantees about, and disclaims any express or implied representations or warranties about such Third Party Resources, including without limitation the security of any Materials, or the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, completeness, or appropriateness for a particular purpose of the information or the resources contained on or made available by such Third Party Resources or any other Internet sites. We reserve the right to terminate such links or such access at any time. The fact that we offer such links or access should not be construed in any way as an endorsement, authorization, or sponsorship of such Third Party Resources, or any content made available thereby. Because some Third Party Resources employ automated search results or otherwise link you to Third Party Resources containing information that may be deemed inappropriate or offensive, we cannot be held responsible for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in or made available by Third Party Resources, including the weekly circular ads available online, and you hereby irrevocably waive any claim against us with respect to such Third Party Resources. Your use of any Third Party Resources is subject to the Third Party's terms, conditions and policies applicable to such products, services or materials (such as Terms of Service or Privacy Policies of the providers of such products, services or materials). CVS is not responsible for the privacy and security of any information you share with that Third Party, including your credit card or payment information. For example, our photo processing services are provided by Snapfish (or another Third Party) and some delivery services are provided by a Third Party. When you elect to receive these services from a Third Party, you agree to hold that Third Party responsible for any unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information.


Governing Law

This Agreement, your use of the Service, all transactions through the Service, and all related matters, regardless of your location, are governed solely by, and construed solely in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, excluding any rules of private international law or the conflict of laws which would lead to the application of any other laws.

Dispute Resolution

EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES THAT QUALIFY FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT, ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU, ON THE ONE HAND, AND CVS OR ITS SUPPLIERS OR VENDORS, ON THE OTHER HAND, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF IN A COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY AND YOU AGREE THAT CVS AND YOU ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY A JURY. YOU AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED AND YOU ARE AGREEING TO GIVE UP THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (currently available at https://www.adr.org/aaa/faces/rules/searchrules/rulesdetail?doc=ADRSTAGE2021424), as amended by this Agreement. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. If you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, CVS will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. The arbitrator's decision will follow the terms of this Agreement and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of this Agreement, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.

With the exception of any of the language above in this Dispute Resolution provision relating to the waiver of class and representative actions, if a court decides that any part of this Dispute Resolution provision is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Dispute Resolution provision shall still apply. If a court decides that any aspect of the language above in this Dispute Resolution provision relating to the waiver of class and representative actions is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution provision shall be null and void. The remainder of the Agreement will continue to apply and be unaffected by this severability provision.


Copyright Infringement Claims: Notice and Take-Down Procedures

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials available on the Service infringe your rights under U.S. copyright law, you (or your agent) may send to CVS a written notice by mail, e-mail or fax, requesting that CVS remove such material or block access to it. If you believe in good faith that someone has wrongly filed a notice of copyright infringement against you, the DMCA permits you to send to CVS a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must be sent in writing and meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA (see http://www.copyright.gov/ for details), which, with respect to notices of infringement, currently include, among other requirements, the following:

1. Sufficient information identifying the copyrighted work(s) believed to be infringed.

2. Sufficient information identifying the allegedly infringing material(s) and the location of such material(s) in order to permit CVS to locate such material(s).

3. A statement from the owner (or the owner's authorized representative) of the copyrighted work(s) believed to be infringed that such owner or authorized representative has a good faith belief that the allegedly infringing materials are used in a manner not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

4. Contact information for the complaining party, including a mailing address, a telephone number and, if available, an email address.

5. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

6. A signature or the electronic equivalent from the owner (or the owner's authorized representative) of the copyrighted work(s) believed to be infringed.

Notices and counter-notices must be sent in writing to CVS's DMCA agent as follows:

General Information

In addition to the rights and privileges described in the terms, conditions, and policies outlined above, we further reserve the right to elect to electronically monitor areas of the Service and may disclose any content, records, or electronic communication of any kind if required to do so by any law, regulation, or government request, if such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to operate the Service, or to protect our rights or property, or the rights of the users, partners, affiliates, sponsors, providers, licensors, or merchants. If alerted to allegedly infringing, defamatory, damaging, illegal, or offensive content, we may investigate the allegation and determine in our sole discretion whether to remove or request the removal of such content from the Service.

We control the Service from our corporate offices within the United States of America, and the Service is not intended to subject CVS to any non-U.S. jurisdiction or law. By accessing and using the Service you agree that such access and use is subject to the terms, conditions, and policies of this Agreement as well as applicable laws. Our failure to insist upon strict performance of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as an implicit waiver of any provision or right.

If any part of this Agreement is ruled to be unenforceable, then such part shall be severed, with the remainder of the Agreement remaining in full force and effect. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and CVS governing your use of the Service. You may not assign, transfer or sublicense any or all of your rights or obligations under this Agreement without our express prior written consent. We may assign, transfer or sublicense any or all of our rights or obligations under this Agreement without restriction.

We hereby notify you that parental control protections (such as computer hardware, software or filtering services) are commercially available that may assist you in limiting access to material that is harmful to minors.

The Service may contain or make available forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. In addition, CVS Health Corporation and its subsidiaries, including CVS (collectively, "CVS Group"), and its and their representatives may, from time to time, make written or verbal forward-looking statements, including statements contained in CVS Health Corporation's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in the CVS Group's reports to stockholders, press releases, webcasts, conference calls, meetings and other communications. Generally, the inclusion of the words "believe," "expect," "intend," "estimate," "project," "anticipate," "will," "should" and similar expressions identify statements that constitute forward-looking statements. All statements addressing operating performance of CVS Health Corporation or any subsidiary, events or developments that the CVS Group expects or anticipates will occur in the future, as well as statements expressing optimism or pessimism about future operating results or events, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The forward-looking statements are and will be based upon management's then-current views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance, and are applicable only as of the dates of such statements. The CVS Group undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons as described in CVS Health Corporation's SEC filings, including those set forth in the Risk Factors section of CVS Health Corporation's current Form 10-K filed with the SEC. There can be no assurance that CVS Health Corporation has correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting its business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to CVS Health Corporation or that it currently believes to be immaterial also may adversely impact the CVS Group. Should any risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, these developments could have a material adverse effect on the CVS Group's business, financial condition and results of operations. For these reasons, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the CVS Group's forward-looking statements.

Text Messaging Terms and Conditions

CVS Pharmacy, Inc. or one or more of its affiliates (CVS) offers access to pharmacy and healthcare service messages via recurring SMS (Short Message Service) and MMS (Multimedia Message Service) text alerts. Enrollment in text alerts requires a patient to provide his or her own mobile phone number with an area code within the 50 United States or the District of Columbia. By enrolling to receive CVS text alerts, you agree to these terms and conditions, which become effective upon your enrollment. You may be asked to verify your mobile phone number before the service will start. This requires responding to a text alert sent to your mobile phone confirming your enrollment in this Service.


You acknowledge that text alerts will be sent to the mobile phone number you provide to CVS. Such alerts may include limited personal information about your prescriptions, and whoever has access to the mobile phone or carrier account will also be able to see this information. Once you enroll, the frequency of text alerts we send to you will vary. You will typically receive text alerts when we have information for you about your prescriptions or other healthcare information. CVS Pharmacy does not impose a separate charge for text alerts; however, your mobile carrier's message and data rates may apply depending on the terms and conditions of your mobile phone contract. You are solely responsible for all message and data charges that you incur. Please contact your mobile service provider about such charges. The following carriers are supported: AT&T, Sprint, Boost, Verizon Wireless, U.S. CellularÂ®, T-MobileÂ®, Cincinnati Bell, Alltel, Virgin Mobile USA, Cellular South, Unicel, Centennial and nTelos. You may opt out of CVS text alerts at any time. To stop receiving text alerts, text STOP to CVSTXT (287898). Texting STOP to CVSTXT (287898) will opt you out of any and all future CVS text messages. After you submit a request to unsubscribe, you will receive one final text alert from CVS confirming that you will no longer receive text alerts. No additional text alerts will be sent unless you re-activate your enrollment. For questions about text alerts, text the word Help to CVSTXT (287898) or contact CVS at 1-877-833-9620. You also can change your text alert preferences on CVS.com if you have an account with prescription management. Sign in and go to your pharmacy main page. Click on the On/Off button in the Pharmacy Messages section to change your preferences.


The CVS text alert programs are offered on an "as is" basis and: (1) may not be available in all areas at all times; and (2) may not continue to work in the event of product, software, coverage or other service changes made by your wireless carrier. CVS may change or discontinue any of its text alert programs without notice or liability to you. CVS and its related companies and each of their respective officers, directors and employees are not responsible and shall not be liable for any losses or injuries of any kind resulting, directly or indirectly, from any CVS text alert program or from technical failures or delays of any kind. CVS reserves the right to cease delivery of text alerts to any person at anytime in its sole discretion.



Third Party Resources

The Service may contain links to, or otherwise make available, third-party sites, services, products, information, content, materials, merchandise, functionality and/or other resources ("Third Party Resources"). These links and access are provided for your convenience and reference only. We do not control such Third Party Resources and, therefore, we are not responsible for such Third Party Resources, or any content posted on or made available by such Third Party Resources. Be aware that CVS does not control, makes no guarantees about, and disclaims any express or implied representations or warranties about such Third Party Resources, including without limitation the security of any Materials, or the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, completeness, or appropriateness for a particular purpose of the information or the resources contained on or made available by such Third Party Resources or any other Internet sites. We reserve the right to terminate such links or such access at any time. The fact that we offer such links or access should not be construed in any way as an endorsement, authorization, or sponsorship of such Third Party Resources, or any content made available thereby. Because some Third Party Resources employ automated search results or otherwise link you to Third Party Resources containing information that may be deemed inappropriate or offensive, we cannot be held responsible for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in or made available by Third Party Resources, including the weekly circular ads available online, and you hereby irrevocably waive any claim against us with respect to such Third Party Resources. Your use of any Third Party Resources is subject to the Third Party's terms, conditions and policies applicable to such products, services or materials (such as Terms of Service or Privacy Policies of the providers of such products, services or materials). CVS is not responsible for the privacy and security of any information you share with that Third Party, including your credit card or payment information. For example, our photo processing services are provided by Snapfish (or another Third Party) and some delivery services are provided by a Third Party. When you elect to receive these services from a Third Party, you agree to hold that Third Party responsible for any unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information.



Governing Law

This Agreement, your use of the Service, all transactions through the Service, and all related matters, regardless of your location, are governed solely by, and construed solely in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, excluding any rules of private international law or the conflict of laws which would lead to the application of any other laws.


Dispute Resolution

EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES THAT QUALIFY FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT, ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU, ON THE ONE HAND, AND CVS OR ITS SUPPLIERS OR VENDORS, ON THE OTHER HAND, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF IN A COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY AND YOU AGREE THAT CVS AND YOU ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY A JURY. YOU AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED AND YOU ARE AGREEING TO GIVE UP THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (currently available at https://www.adr.org/aaa/faces/rules/searchrules/rulesdetail?doc=ADRSTAGE2021424), as amended by this Agreement. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. If you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, CVS will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. The arbitrator's decision will follow the terms of this Agreement and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of this Agreement, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.


With the exception of any of the language above in this Dispute Resolution provision relating to the waiver of class and representative actions, if a court decides that any part of this Dispute Resolution provision is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Dispute Resolution provision shall still apply. If a court decides that any aspect of the language above in this Dispute Resolution provision relating to the waiver of class and representative actions is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution provision shall be null and void. The remainder of the Agreement will continue to apply and be unaffected by this severability provision.



Copyright Infringement Claims: Notice and Take-Down Procedures

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials available on the Service infringe your rights under U.S. copyright law, you (or your agent) may send to CVS a written notice by mail, e-mail or fax, requesting that CVS remove such material or block access to it. If you believe in good faith that someone has wrongly filed a notice of copyright infringement against you, the DMCA permits you to send to CVS a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must be sent in writing and meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA (see http://www.copyright.gov/ for details), which, with respect to notices of infringement, currently include, among other requirements, the following:


1. Sufficient information identifying the copyrighted work(s) believed to be infringed.


2. Sufficient information identifying the allegedly infringing material(s) and the location of such material(s) in order to permit CVS to locate such material(s).


3. A statement from the owner (or the owner's authorized representative) of the copyrighted work(s) believed to be infringed that such owner or authorized representative has a good faith belief that the allegedly infringing materials are used in a manner not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.


4. Contact information for the complaining party, including a mailing address, a telephone number and, if available, an email address.


5. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.


6. A signature or the electronic equivalent from the owner (or the owner's authorized representative) of the copyrighted work(s) believed to be infringed.


Notices and counter-notices must be sent in writing to CVS's DMCA agent as follows:

General Information

In addition to the rights and privileges described in the terms, conditions, and policies outlined above, we further reserve the right to elect to electronically monitor areas of the Service and may disclose any content, records, or electronic communication of any kind if required to do so by any law, regulation, or government request, if such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to operate the Service, or to protect our rights or property, or the rights of the users, partners, affiliates, sponsors, providers, licensors, or merchants. If alerted to allegedly infringing, defamatory, damaging, illegal, or offensive content, we may investigate the allegation and determine in our sole discretion whether to remove or request the removal of such content from the Service.


We control the Service from our corporate offices within the United States of America, and the Service is not intended to subject CVS to any non-U.S. jurisdiction or law. By accessing and using the Service you agree that such access and use is subject to the terms, conditions, and policies of this Agreement as well as applicable laws. Our failure to insist upon strict performance of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as an implicit waiver of any provision or right.
If any part of this Agreement is ruled to be unenforceable, then such part shall be severed, with the remainder of the Agreement remaining in full force and effect. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and CVS governing your use of the Service. You may not assign, transfer or sublicense any or all of your rights or obligations under this Agreement without our express prior written consent. We may assign, transfer or sublicense any or all of our rights or obligations under this Agreement without restriction.


We hereby notify you that parental control protections (such as computer hardware, software or filtering services) are commercially available that may assist you in limiting access to material that is harmful to minors. Information identifying current providers of such protections is available from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_content-control_software_and_providers. Please note that CVS does not endorse any of the products or services listed on such site.

The Service may contain or make available forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. In addition, CVS Health Corporation and its subsidiaries, including CVS (collectively, "CVS Group"), and its and their representatives may, from time to time, make written or verbal forward-looking statements, including statements contained in CVS Health Corporation's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in the CVS Group's reports to stockholders, press releases, webcasts, conference calls, meetings and other communications. Generally, the inclusion of the words "believe," "expect," "intend," "estimate," "project," "anticipate," "will," "should" and similar expressions identify statements that constitute forward-looking statements. All statements addressing operating performance of CVS Health Corporation or any subsidiary, events or developments that the CVS Group expects or anticipates will occur in the future, as well as statements expressing optimism or pessimism about future operating results or events, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The forward-looking statements are and will be based upon management's then-current views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance, and are applicable only as of the dates of such statements. The CVS Group undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons as described in CVS Health Corporation's SEC filings, including those set forth in the Risk Factors section of CVS Health Corporation's current Form 10-K filed with the SEC. There can be no assurance that CVS Health Corporation has correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting its business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to CVS Health Corporation or that it currently believes to be immaterial also may adversely impact the CVS Group. Should any risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, these developments could have a material adverse effect on the CVS Group's business, financial condition and results of operations. For these reasons, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the CVS Group's forward-looking statements.
